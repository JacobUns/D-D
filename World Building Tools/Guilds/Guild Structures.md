# Roles
## Guildmaster
The leader and ultimate decision-maker of the guild. Guildmasters are accountable for and oversees the entire operation of the guild, setting policies, managing relations with outside organisations, and making strategic decisions. They may delegate some of the daily operation of the guild to members of a [[#Council of Elders|council]], but may equally retain control of all guild responsibilities. 
## Council of Elders
A group of experienced adventurers, often former [[#Guildmaster|Guildmasters]] or legendary figures, who provide guidance and wisdom. They make major guild-wide decisions, approve expeditions, and ensure the guild’s stability.
## Master of Recruits
Responsible for evaluating and selecting new recruits. The Master of Recruits is also in charge of the initial training phase and makes recommendations on whether a recruit is ready to advance. Not every guild may have a master of recruits, as some may have a set pathway with feats of skill determining progression with a set number of apprentices taken on each year from a city or province. Others may require actively going out to seek potential recruits, and the orchestration of this is the responsibility of the Master of Recruits.
## Guild Archivist
The guild’s historian and record keeper, responsible for maintaining records of all missions, events, and discoveries made by the guild. They are also responsible for transcribing knowledge and passing on wisdom from past generations. They may also perform secretarial tasks in smaller guilds, but larger guilds will have an apprentice archivist that perform these tasks. As a result, the apprentice would usually succeed their master at retirement thereby continuing the meticulous record keeping.
## Field Captain & Master Craftsman
Field Captains are the leaders of expedition teams. They organise and execute quests, manage the logistics of traveling parties, and handle the day-to-day challenges of leading groups into dangerous environments. The will also act as mentors for a varying levels of adventurer, but more often focus on senior members.
## Senior Guild Member
Senior Guild members are trusted with more difficult and dangerous quests. They mentor [[#Journeymen]] and are expected to guide and protect younger members while tackling high-stakes challenges. Many Senior Adventurers eventually ascend to higher ranks.
## Journeyman Guild Member
After proving themselves in basic tasks, Journeymen are given more independent missions. They begin to specialise in certain fields, such as combat, healing, magic, or exploration. Journeymen may work in small teams or solo.
## Apprentice Guild Member
The first rank for new recruits. Apprentices undergo a series of trials and training to develop their skills. They are assigned basic tasks, such as gathering resources or patrolling dangerous areas under the guidance of a higher-ranked member.
