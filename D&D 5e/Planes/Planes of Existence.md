# About
The planes of a world are a concept of multi-dimensional existence that allows for significantly more creativity and possibilities within a fantasy world. Classically, within the D&D Universe, these are broken into segments of:
- [[Upper Planes]]
- [[Lower Planes]]
- [[Inner Planes]]
- [[Outer Planes]]
- [[Planes of Law]]
- [[Planes of Chaos]]
- [[Positive Planes]]
- [[Negative Planes]]

There are different ways of depicting the concept. The above uses is "The Great Wheel" model, but there is also the depiction as a "World Tree" model within D&D.

Through different iterations of D&D, some planes, such as the [[Astral Plane]], have gone through name changes of the concept but still exist in their function. The use of certain planes can act as interesting story points and storytelling mechanisms through spells, concepts of teleportation, divine gates among other concepts within a fantasy world.

Most stories run by a dungeon master are likely to exist within what is referred to as the [[Material Plane]], which houses the world as we think of it in our own reality. This is traditionally mirrored in two accompanying planes called the [[Shadowfell]] and [[Feywild]].

The [[Feywild]] is a very common fantasy concept, with authors such as Patrick Rothfus having very similar concepts in books such as his King Killer Chronicles series with the plane that houses the lair of Felurian and the Cthaeh.
