# Planes
The Inner Planes contain eight planes within the concept of the [Great Wheel](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Wheel_cosmology) cosmology. These are the:
- [[Material Plane]]
- [[Feywild]]
- [[Shadowfell]]
- [[Elemental Planes]]
	- [[Elemental Planes#Fire|Fire]]
	- [[Elemental Planes#Air|Air]]
	- [[Elemental Planes#Water|Water]]
	- [[Elemental Planes#Earth|Earth]]

The space between these eight planes is known by many names, but all refer to the same thing with slight variations on the concept. For the purpose of this toolkit, it will be referred to as the [[Astral Plane]].

The [[Elemental Planes]] are the outer-most group of planes within the sphere of the Inner Planes. Surrounding the space between the [[Elemental Planes]] and each of the [[Outer Planes]] is something known as [[Elemental Chaos]].
