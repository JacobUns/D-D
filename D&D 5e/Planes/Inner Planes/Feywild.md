# About
The concepts of the Feywild pull heavily from the traditional fairytales of writers such as the Brothers Grimm and the concepts of Eastern European folk lore. Everything imaginable exists in this plane, from hags to faeries.

Unfortunately, the contents of the Feywild has been fairly light in the source materials from Wizards.
