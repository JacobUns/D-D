# Description of the keep
> The keep can been seen from miles, but as you approach it is truly an impressive sight. Atop a rocky crag overlooking the sea stands the massive citadel, defying time and nature as it has for centuries. It's easy to see how it has come to compared to a cake with too many candles by those that live nearby. The citadel's high walls interspersed with towers, within which stand more towers of varying sizes.

>As you approach closer, you get a sense of the size of the whole thing. With 15-foot-thick walls that stand 50-feet-tall, Candlekeep truly is an intimidating sight. A single road leads up to two massive gates. 
- Stands atop a rocky crag overlooking the sea
- The massive citadel has stood for centuries and defied the degradation of time
- Visible for miles with an eye-catching silhouette: high wall interspersed with towers, within which stands even more towers
- From a distance those that live close claim the keep looks like a cake decorated with too many candles
- Walls surround the citadel
    - Fifty-foot-tall
    - Fifteen-foot-thick
    - Iron-reinforced stone

## Inhabitants of the Keep
- Cloistered community of Scholars
- Enjoy friendly debate and Enlightened conversation
- Scholars and sages called [[Avowed]]
	- Responsible for the care and cataloguing of all the knowledge it holds

# Entering the Keep
- Only one road leading up to the entrance called “Way of the lion” 
- The entrance is a double gate that stands at the end of the road

> As you approach the gates of Candlekeep you see a group of people standing at the doors which stand 20-feet-high and are made out of ornately decorated iron. Each bares the sigil of Candlekeep, which looks to be the silhouette of the keep against the moon's light. One door stands just wide enough open to allow those admitted that seem to have been admitted into the keep. 

## Description of Gates
- Each Black Metal door is ornately decorated with the sigil of Candlekeep.
    - Magically warded
        - Can’t be damaged
- Three times the height of a human
- One gate stands open far enough to admit visitors during the day, the other kept shut

## Entrance Fee
>As you approach, you can see the group standing outside a bit clearer, and see five men are talking quietly with groups of individuals, and seem to be assessing books, scrolls and other works of academia. 
- A work of writing not already collected therein
    -   Exceptional cases
        -   Accept rare editions of tomes already in the collection
        -   Accept odd works annotated by a prominent scholar outside the library
- Anyone that turns up without such a gift is kindly but firmly turned away
- Five Avowed oversee the front gate
    -   Examine and discuss written works provided for the entry fee
    -   If a question arises, they send a runner to consult with sages in the library
        -   The runner will return with a missive of acceptance or denial
    -   Bells at dawn, highsun and sundown signal changing of the Gate guards

```ad-info
- Experienced scholars in this often bring a selection of possible donations to ensure admittance
- Advise assembling a “wish list” of works that members of senior staff are interested in        
	- Reduces guesswork of readmission on future visits
```

# Defences
Numerous magical defences protect the library, mostly to protect library books from mould, weevils, and other threats.

## Notable defences
### Magic Restriction
Any flaws in the defences are noted as part of the restriction

#### Forced Entry
- Prevent anyone from entering Candlekeep by any route other than the front gates
- Any attempt to magically bypass the gates fail
- Does not prevent creatures from magically exiting the keep

#### Flight
- Anyone attempting to fly into the keep stops short
- Medium creatures with Natural flight are either forced to land outside the keep or navigate around it
- Magical flight is dispelled and the subject floats slowly to the ground fifty feet outside the gate

#### Flaws
- Tiny Birds are not affected
    - Clever wizards or other individuals can bypass the ward by assuming the form of a tiny bird
    - The [[Avowed]] don’t discuss this flaw with outsiders

### Fire Suppression
- Flames larger than a candle are suppressed within the keep
    - The fireplace in the Hearth tavern is an exception
- Any spell that creates fire is wasted

### Theft Protection
- Every book, scroll or other work considered part of of Candlekeep’s collection is magically protected against theft
- Any work removed from the keep disappears and immediately returns to its proper place in the library

#### Flaws
- If a page or part of a scroll is torn away, these fragments can be removed from Candlekeep as long as the bulk of the work remains in the library
    - This is not discussed by the [[Avowed]]
- If a work is split into pieces and entirely removed, only the largest piece disappears and returns to its proper place in the library
    - This is not discussed by the [[Avowed]]

### Shielding Mythal
- From any location in Candlekeep, the Keeper of Tomes can activate a Mythal
- An exceptional, unbreakable magical effect, that envelops all of Candlekeep in a protective shield through which nothing but air and sound can pass

### [[Miirym]]
- A spectral dragon named [[Miirym]] prowls the keep and can be called to aid in the protection of Candlekeep if the library or citadel comes under attack from those that want to destroy or pillage the keep.
