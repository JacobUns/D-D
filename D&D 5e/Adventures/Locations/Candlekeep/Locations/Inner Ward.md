# Inner Ward
A forest of stone towers clumped around stockier buildings, all joined together in the shadow of a high-walled citadel called Exaltation

[[Candlekeep]] has invisible doorways to dozens of permanent extradimensional spaces, some as small as a room at an inn, and others as large as the space created by a Demiplane or Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion spell.

The Avowed try to keep track of all the extradimensional spaces in [[Candlekeep]], yet a few forgotten doorways lurk in the library, their locations or access requirements lost. Valuable books, scrolls, and other items may be trapped inside these extradimensional spaces.

When an extradimensional space is rediscovered, it must be thoroughly explored, the resources within catalogued, and the space tested for stability. When an extradimensional space is no longer desired or needed, the archmages of [[Candlekeep]] dispel it.

## Great Library
- The Avowed transported the towers of the Great Library from other locations and painstakingly reassembled them  
- Results in a patchwork of different architectural styles and materials
    - Among the stone structures are a few made of strange materials like infernal iron and bones of a long-dead colossal red dragon
- The oldest of the library buildings are soaring stone affairs with floors crafted from lustrous dark wood and floor-to-ceiling shelves
- Ceiling heights vary from 10 to 100 feet in the tallest towers.
- The Avowed use floating disks, each one large enough to hold 3 medium creatures to reach high shelves
- The well-travelled areas are well lit, and the Avowed employ driftglobes when visiting remote areas.
- An intricate arrangement of mounted mirrors lights the upper reaches of the tallest chambers, reflecting sunlight by day or using magic on cloudy days and at night

### Contents of the Library
- The largest repository of written lore in the world  
- Includes the prophecies of an ancient sage named [[Alaundo the Seer]]
    - A tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge and secrets in the collection
- Holds thousands of lost recipes, old songs, collections of folklore, and journals written by folks whose time has long since passed
- The abundance of these ancillary works makes finding notable tomes an exercise in patience and perseverance

### Modrons
- Thirteen rogue Modrons are employed by the Avowed and work alongside the Avowed to catalogue and shelve books, though each of them can manage only one book at a time

## Exaltation
- The Bastion of Exaltation is the tallest and most heavily defended structure in [[Candlekeep]].
- From the citadel’s stone battlements, one can see over the walls of [[Candlekeep]] in every direction
- Avowed live in Exaltation
- No visitors are welcome unless they’ve made an extraordinary donation or performed a special favour for the Avowed
