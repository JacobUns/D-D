# General
- There are secret stairs all over [[Candlekeep]]
- Stairs lead to dusty vaults and catacombs that hold the oldest books
- The flooded caves at sea level are haunted by all manner of strange creatures
- A spectral dragon called [[Miirym]] prowls the catacombs and caves under the library

## [[Miirym]] the Sentinel Wyrm


## Echoes of Alaundo
- Prismatic Gemstones stored beneath the keep in the catacombs
- Store the recordings of [[Alaundo the Seer]]
- Only the First Reader and Keeper of Tomes can get the recordings to play
- Each gemstone holds a prophecy
- Antiquated version of common the is impossible to understand without magic
- Prophecies can be easily misinterpreted, so First Reader and Keeper of Tomes rarely consult or take advantage of the echoes

## Chamber of Lost Lore
- Past [[Miirym]] and the Echoes
- Rough-hewn chamber lit by magic
- Can gain the power to contact long-dead sages that are willing to share their insights and knowledge
- High-ranking members of the Avowed make use of the chamber, few Seekers know why

Any creature with Intelligence of 8 or higher that spends 1 hour meditating in the chamber gains the ability to cast the Contact Other Plane spell once, allowing the creature to commune with a spirit. The spell doesnâ€™t need to be cast right away, nor does it need to be cast in the chamber. If the spell is not cast within 24 hours, however, it is lost
