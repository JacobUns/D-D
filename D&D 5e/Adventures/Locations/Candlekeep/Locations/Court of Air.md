## The Hearth
### Description
- From the outside the Hearth appears to be a modest tavern of sturdy construction
- Warm light emanates from a pair of small windows on either side of the front door
- As you enter the tavern, you quickly realise that it’s three times more spacious on the inside
- An intricate clockwork device is suspended in a two-foot-diameter, faintly glowing crystal orb embedded in the ceiling over the bar

- In the centre of the tavern there is a crackling fireplace surrounded by very comfortable-looking, cushiony armchairs
- Looking around the tavern you see a lot of Avowed and a number of Seekers scattered around the tables and bar area
- In one corner of the tavern you see something that stands out from the rest of the crowd, an Ogre sits in the corner reading. As some of the avowed pass you see a couple of them saying hello and making small talk with it before continuing on with their business.
- Around the perimeter of the tavern you see a number of doors you didn’t see from the outside of the tavern

### Information
- The Hearth gained its larger dimensions courtesy of extradimensional magic created by worshipers of Gond (god of craft)
- The intricate clockwork device is called a “Geometric amplifier”
    - It is the source of the magic required to maintain the integrity of the enlarged space
- The Ogre’s name is Little One. He is a Chaotic Good [Ogre](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16969-ogre) wearing a [headband of intellect](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4652-headband-of-intellect). He’s most often found sitting by himself in a corner of the Hearth’s taproom, reading a book.
    - Background
        - A few years ago, the ogre was like many others of his kind—brutish and cruel. He met a halfling adventurer wearing the shiny gold headband and killed the puny runt for it. When the ogre attuned to it, the headband grew in size, enabling him to wear it. With an improved ability to reason and ponder, the ogre felt compelled to appreciate the error of his ways and seek out a better life. He adopted the name Little One, to honour the halfling whose life he cut short.
        - Shunned by polite society, Little One came to [[Candlekeep]] hoping to learn as much as he could. He’s a quiet but popular fixture in the keep, and the Avowed are always saying hello to him and recommending new books for him to read. He is currently reading Storm King’s Thunder, by Scriers Phink. This book follows the exploits of a band of adventurers searching for a storm giant king named Hekaton, whose sudden disappearance caused great upheaval up and down the Sword Coast some years ago.
    - Little One can be used to introduce PCs to rare books such as the ones described throughout this adventure.  
    - Little One doesn’t mind sharing whatever book he is currently enjoying
