# Description
> The marbled walls extend the length of the mansion, the 15-foot-tall ceilings supported by fine wooden beams. Brass lamps that on first inspection look to be oil lamps that you'd expect to hold a flame emanate some kind of light you assume is powered magically, but made to flicker like a flame would.
> 
> The walls bear fine dark red velvet curtains that compliment the dark wood floor, and as you cast your eyes down the length of the wall you see a total of 5 doors spread down its length, with a staircase that leads somewhere you can't see from the bottom. Each door along the wall seems to have a symbol attached to its front, and at each end of the hallway you see two more doors but these don't have symbols. Two of the doors, directly in front and right of you, seem to be slightly ajar and emanate a low light. From inside the ajar door on the right of you you can hear some kind of scratching as if something is moving around inside.
