# Description
> As you approach the room you find the door ajar, and a soft orange glow coming from inside. 
> 
> As you enter, you see floor to ceiling bookshelves around the room, all stocked full of books and scrolls, and there are yet more books and papers scattered around the room in small piles. There are also several paintings around the room
> 
> The first thing that catches your eye though, is a desk in the middle of the room with three comfortable looking armchairs around it, and on the one facing you is a black fluffy cat which sits up and meows at you, then jumps down off the table and approaches.

## Paintings
- One is a landscape scene with a large green dragon emerging from a grove of pine trees
- One is a study of a Pegasus in flight
- One is a portrait of a unicorn in a wooded glade

## Cat
If any of the feed the cat:
> The cat purrs loudly and rubs up against your leg.

If anyone pets the cat:
> Make an Animal Handling Check for me

If no one pays attention to the cat:
> Seemingly bored, the cat pushes past the door, rubbing against it on the way out, and then turns towards one of the other rooms.

DC 10 Animal Handling
On a success:
> The cat seems to take a liking to you, and sticks close

On a fail:
> The cat seems thankful for the attention, but moves away from you and sits by the door for a minute cleaning itself

### Leaving the Study
After leaving the study:
- If the party successfully befriended the cat it follows them while they're on the middle level.
- If the party failed to befriend the cat it leaves for the kitchen

# Information to be found
After spending 30 minutes investigating the books and papers in the room:
> As you dig through the books and papers, you find that most of them are written by someone called Fistandia, who appears to have been a powerful mage as well as a priest of someone called Mystra. Fistandia frequented Candlekeep often to further her studies. Through her service and achievements in expanding the arts of Magic, Mystra granted Fistandia this permanent extradimensional mansion for her to reside in while studying in Candlekeep.
>
> As you continue to search you find that most of the papers and books are journals and memoirs written by Fistandia herself, and one of the journals you find appears to be from her acquisition of this mansion. She details how she was concerned that a guest may become trapped in the mansion, and so she hid a command word to open the portal back to Candlekeep on the spines of seven books in the mansion.

# Entries and Exits
- [[Fistandia's Foyer]]
- Secret entry to a staircase leading to the [[Lower Level Hallway]].

# Puzzle Book
>You find a book that seems a bit different from any of the other books in the shelves, specifically that it seems to have a very faint glow on the spine. As you inspect it closer, you find that the glowing comes from a single letter I. 

# Secrets
- There is a secret door behind the left bookcase on the far wall.
- When the bottom leftmost book in the bookcase is pulled, the bookcase slides forward to reveal the passage behind it.
- A character who makes a DC 10 Investigation check discovers the book

> You spend some time poking through the books on the left bookcase on the far wall, and something just strikes you immediately that something doesn't quite seem right. You start poking through the books and notice that one is slightly further out than the rest of them, but it doesn't seem any bigger. Pushing on it you find that nothing seems to happen, but as you go to pull on it you feel resistance, as if it's attached to something. Do you want to continue pulling on it?

If they do:
> You pull harder on the book, and you hear a click. You take a step back, and as you do the bookshelf starts to shift and slide. After a few tense seconds, you see an entry behind the bookshelf, and as you poke your head through the portal, you see a staircase leading down.
