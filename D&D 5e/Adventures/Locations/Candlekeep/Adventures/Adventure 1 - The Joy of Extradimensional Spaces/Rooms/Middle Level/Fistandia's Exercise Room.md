# Description
> This room seems to be sparsely furnished, with a battered looking mannequin on one wall, and a rack of weapons on the opposing wall. On the back wall facing the door is a large window, outside which you see roiling indigo [[Miasma]], the light from it bathing the room and tinging everything purple.
>
> The weapon rack seems to hold four daggers of differing shapes, sizes and styles, four quarterstaffs, and a bandolier of 20 darts hanging from one of the pegs. They all seem to be fairly mundane weapons, but they're all finely made.
>
> On the back wall next to the window are diagrams of parry and attack positions for wielders of staffs and daggers, and as you cast your eyes around the room you note stained and scorched marks in many places, but mostly around the mannequin.
> 
> In front back wall is a broom which is hovering in the air and seems to be sweeping the floor by itself.
