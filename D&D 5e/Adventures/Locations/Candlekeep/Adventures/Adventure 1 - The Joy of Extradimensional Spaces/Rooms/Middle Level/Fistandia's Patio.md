# Description
> As you enter you find yourself in a patio paved with grey flagstones. As you step out, you see seemingly endless blackness, but between you and that void you see a [[Miasma]]. 

>As you look around you see little of note, but the whole patio is bathed in the eery light of the [[Miasma]]. The whole area almost feels like a balcony or a viewing area for the void with a couple of stone benches nestled against the outside wall of the mansion. 

# Entries and Exits
> There are two doors leading out of the patio, one has a symbol on it, the other doesn't, and appears to lead back to the main hallway.

1. [[Fistandia's Foyer]]
2. [[Fistandia's Library]]
	- Symbol: A book, open to the middle, with arcane glyphs floating from the pages
