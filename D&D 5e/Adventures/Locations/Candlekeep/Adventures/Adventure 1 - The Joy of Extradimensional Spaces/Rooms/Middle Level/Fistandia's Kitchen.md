# Description
> As you enter the smells of cooking reach your nostrils, and the scents of rich food and exotic spices fill your head. On one wall is a large stove with pans and utensils hanging from it. The walls are filled with racks holding pots, pans, spices and cooking instruments. 
>
> In the middle of the room are large tables with knives, cutting boards and the remains of some kind of meat scattered about. In one of the corners of the room you see where that meat has gone as you see a number of decorated food bowls placed on the floor with water.
>
> There are two doors as you enter, one directly ahead of you and one to your right that seems to lead to a connecting room with a symbol on it's front, which you assume is the next room over. 
>
> Of most note though are two flying creatures that on your entry swoop down onto the table in front of you, bouncing around excitedly. One says "Guests! Guests, guests, guests, guests! It's been so long!", the other quickly chimes in "I am sorry for Cumin! It gets excited quickly. How may we be of service honoured guests? Cooking? Cleaning? Repair your clothes?"
> 
> Before the other is done talking, the one named Cumin flaps off to the stove and starts grabbing bowls, and before you know it is back and trying to push a bowl of something that's sloshing around into your hands.
