# Description
> This swirling Indigo Miasma hovers about 20 feet outside of the building. The chaotic swirling thick vapour seems to wrap around the mansion on all sides. Past the miasma seems to be nothing but blackness, but inside the miasma you see small pinpricks of light, almost like stars.
# Effects
If a creature enters the Miasma:
> As you enter the Miasma you start to feel  increasingly uneasy and almost as if something is pulling at your insides.

Any creature that remains in the Miasma past one minute gains 1 level of exhaustion for every minute spent in it.
