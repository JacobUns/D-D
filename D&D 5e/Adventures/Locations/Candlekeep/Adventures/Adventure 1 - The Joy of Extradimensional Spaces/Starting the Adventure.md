# Pre-requisites to start the quest
-   Must learn of [[Candlekeep]] & its knowledge or [[Matreous]]
-   Must gain access to [[Candlekeep]]
-   Must find someone to direct them to the Pillars of Pedagogy and [[Matreous]]' study area

# Start of the Adventure
-   When the party arrives in the private study room assigned to [[Matreous]], they find it unoccupied

> As you enter the modest study room, you find a room with a large wooden table with several stacks of books in a few spots. They seem fairly haphazardly scattered for the most part, but in a clearing in the centre of the table lies a single open heavy tome.
-   If the party approaches and studies the book, read the description in Adventure 1: The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces

> As you look at the page you see finely written pages that speak about making a portal to a small pocket dimension that could be used as a safe place to stay for short periods of time. In the margins though you see a less precise scratched set of notes that’s not immediately obvious.
-   Party makes a DC 13 Arcana check to decipher the shorthand
    -   On Success:

> The notes describe the ability to make a temporary dimension permanent, and provide a command word “Sceptre” that opens a door
-   On fail, the party can’t decipher the text but can find an Avowed to help decipher the text
-   If the party speak the command word:

> As the word leaves your mouth, you notice a shimmering across the room. A translucent door starts to appear, seemingly not connected to anywhere.

-   If the party doesn’t interact with the door for a few minutes:
> As you stand there and observe the door, it starts to fade, and eventually completely disappears

-   If the characters interact with the door and choose to enter
> As your hand touches the doorknob and you twist, you feel the door unlock and start to open without a sound. Looking inside, you no longer see the wall behind it, but instead you see a wall of luxurious stone. The stone doesn’t seem to match anything you’ve seen inside the keep, and is almost marbled. It looks luxurious and expensive, but not ostentatious. As you stand in the door you see lamps burning in brass fixtures on the wall in front of you with draped curtain of fine dark red velvet which compliment the dark wood floor.

-   If the characters step inside:
> As you step through the doorway and look around, you find that the ceiling which was only about 8 or 9 feet in the small private study now arches fifteen feet overhead, and a long hallway stretches out on either side of the foyer you now stand in. Behind you, the simple single door is now an elegant ironbound oak set of double doors. As you step forward, a middle-aged man walks into the middle of this area wearing grey robes, and startles as he sees you.

[[Matreous]]:

> Oh! Thank the gods you opened the portal door. I’ve been stuck here for the last half an hour trying different command words but none of them seem to have worked
> 
> _He taps his chin and stares around in wonder_
> 
> There must be a treasure trove of information here. Fistandia was quite astounding, there’s no telling what secrets this place holds! For example!
> 
> _He pulls out what looks to be a small statue of an intricately carved imp_
> 
> I found this in one of the rooms! Isn’t it incredible, the craftmanship would make the craftsman who have dedicated their lives to Gond jealous. I intend to take it with me to study back in the keep. I’d dearly love to explore this place further, but I feel I could be much more useful back in Candlekeep. Thanks to the research I’ve done so far on the permanence of temporary spells I can keep the portal open on the other side, else we’ll likely trap ourselves in again.
> 
> What brought you here anyway? This feels like quite the coincidence.

-   If the party explain why they’re here, [[Matreous]] agrees to accompany and help them on the condition they give him their time and efforts and help him explore the mansion.
-   If the party agree [[Matreous]] steps through the double doors leading back to the study room.

> As Matreous steps through the doors, all you hear is a blood curdling shriek from the study room, and as you turn to look behind you, all you see is the doors slamming shut.
> 
> As you turn back, you see the long hallway that seems to run the length of the mansion, with several doors on the wall opposite the entrance.
