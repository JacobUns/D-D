[[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] casts something to emulate the sound of a Heendrill as a distraction, and the group can hear one of the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] call out "the damn thing's got out again". The group flee at full pelt through the encampment and make it out, and head towards towards the outskirts of [[Tourelle]]. On the way, an owl appears overhead and flys down towards the group. The group recognise it as ***Screech***, the companion of [[Tannentraus]]. [[Arabella]] takes a small parchment scroll from Screech's leg and the owl flies off. The scroll requests the group meet him in the basement of the Wet Whistle at dawn.

The group reach [[Tourelle]] and make their way towards another tavern, [[Tourelle#The Mermaid Tavern|the Mermaid]], to wait for the meeting. There, they learn the son of the barmaid of [[Tourelle#The Wet Whistle Tavern|the Wet Whistle]] has gone missing. The boy's name is ***Frankie***; a tall and very skinny boy in his late teens with a mop of light blonde hair. He was seen in the town centre but disappeared. There are rumours he was taken by the [[Knights of Arduum]] as they have been swarming the town recently.

The group makes their way to [[Tourelle#The Wet Whistle Tavern|the Wet Whistle]] and set up in the basement ready to meet [[Tannentraus]]. As time goes on though, he does not appear. Eventually, with a knock at the door, the group open it to find two [[Knights of Arduum]] standing before them. They make to grab the group, and after a scrap that sees the two [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] fall the group manages to fell their attackers. [[Victor Dimmelwald|Victor]] fells the last of them, but uses the dagger from ***Dody***'s to do so. He describes to the group that, with the dagger in the knight's chest, he seemed to see visions mutilated bodies in piles and that a voice had spoken to him, saying that if he follows the path the dagger provides him that power can be his.

The group leave with no sight of [[Tannentraus]], wondering whether he's set the group up or whether something happened to him. As the group attempts to leave the tavern, a group of thugs intercepts again, and, after another short scuffle where one of the thugs is taken captive, some answers start to flow. The captured man is named ***Quintus***. He claims that the group had been sent to kill us by [[Croesus]]. They'd managed to intercept the owl sent by [[Tannentraus]] and had got there first, with the reward of 20 gold pieces per body being an enticing prospect. He claims that they'd also been approached to take the boy, ***Frankie***, back to the Cathedral, but had turned this job down claiming snatching children for mysterious groups was a step too far for the group. The group ask after the High Priest and whether this would have been his order. The thug doesn't know, but gives us the name [[Torrezard]] for the man. After giving up what he knows the group release the man and head out of town.

Knowing [[Tannentraus]] may still be out ready to meet the group, but not feeling safe in the city, we head towards a glade in the forest previously mentioned by the Ranger on the edge of [[Tourelle]]. On our path, a young human female falls out of a tree along our path. She's wearing Hunters Garb and introduces herself as ***Collrinder***, and says she's hiding from the [[Knights of Arduum]], and hearing our approach made a too hasty attempt to hide. She tells us that the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] are raiding the forest once a fortnight and seem to take back everything they can find in the forest. As the group talk to the woman, they hear noises coming from nearby. Climbing around a cliff face, the group hide in bushes to observe the approaching people. The [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] have begun raiding again, and one pulls out an Ostrich egg sized green object that emits a bright light when activated. It releases a harmonic noise that attracts a wolf which is felled easily in one strike by a [[Knights of Arduum|Knight]].

As time goes on, and the group continue to observe the massacre of both woodland and magical creatures in the area, a massive branch flies through the trees and impails one of the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]] through the chest. The group, seeing an opportunity to stop the slaughter, jump into action and attack the [[Knights of Arduum|Knights]], and to their relief are greeted by [[Tannentraus]] riding an Ent which is introduced to the group as **Alfie***. Gathering and conversing, the group agree to gather more information on the encampment and, disguising themselves as [[Knights of Arduum]], tie up the slaughtered beasts, load them onto carts brought to the glade by their fallen foes, and make their way to regroup with the others.
