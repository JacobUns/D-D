# About
Aothir is the homebrew work of Jacob, the author of this page and handbook. In pulls from a variety of sources in media, including that of the original source works of Wizards of the Coast, Greek and Celtic Mythology, and works of fiction by such authors as Patrick Rothfuss, Brandon Sanderson and Robert Jordan.

Primarily a high fantasy universe, the world of Aothir is a high magic setting. The powers of the arcane have also become a propellant for technology and scientific research, though the practices are in their infancy in comparison to our own. The existence of developing technology that would resemble that of the Napoleonic era is still some distance off, and as such the most common tools of war remain that of the bow and blade. Arcane and mechanical firearms have their place among the elite, and will be used in the defence of large cities should they come under attack. This, of course, also means that there is an existence of firearms in the criminal underworld.
