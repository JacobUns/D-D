## About
Created by Andy Hall for his games to exist within, this homebrew world sees a mix of influences from across all types of fantasy and sci-fi inspired content. The world building and it's associated lore lives on the [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/r-ellanthas-hidden-town-gm) page owned and created by Andy, and holds significant information that this repository of information will not duplicate unless adaptation has been completed for world purposes. In the event of any major updates not seen within the [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/r-ellanthas-hidden-town-gm) page, permission will have been sought out before. As it is not owned by the creator of this page, the ultimate source of truth should be considered the [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/r-ellanthas-hidden-town-gm) page.
## World Building
### Pantheon
The [[Pantheon of R'Ellanthas]], which was originally from the [World Anvil](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/r-ellanthas-hidden-town-gm) page, has been heavily adapted by Jacob in agreement with Andy to aid in the ability for Jacob's character [[Aolani]] to be able to provide information to the party when necessary. What started as a small project has turned into a large effort that will continue to expand over time. The associated progress can be seen below.
