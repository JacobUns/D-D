# Combat
## Crits
Melee Crits - Max Weapon Roll + Weapon Dice Roll
Spell Crits - Double Dice Roll
## Minions
Minions only have 1 health, and damage dealt to a minion within 5ft of another spills over allowing for multiple targets to be killed within the same strike. These must be inline to achieve this, and can be affected by both ranged and melee attacks.
