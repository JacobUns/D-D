# About
## Backstory
### Summary
Kept hostage by a man named Piper from a baby, Kayn was regularly experimented on through his early and formative years. Through torture, Kayn would come to learn the arcane arts against his will.

The results of this are plain to see on his right arm, as it is covered in scars of varying shapes and sizes, but is punctuated by a 4-inch long by 1.5-inch wide shard of a smoky obsidian-like, but loosely transparent, gemstone embedded just off-centre.

He claims to have been let loose on a township that ended in smouldering ruin, coming to after blacking out in the mud. He doesn't know if Piper is chasing him down or whether he has been left to die or be captured by those that come to investigate the ruined town.

He doesn't know his age, but he guesses somewhere between his mid twenties and early thirties; a guess only made by the rough guesses of those he's known. He's driven by pure rage and hatred for Piper, and his venturing into the mountains is, in his mind, purely to find the power to destroy mountains that would ultimately let him kill the man that tortured him for years.
### Detailed
> [!spoiler]- Spoilers Ahead
> Known only by Kayn, a name given to him by the closest father figure and teacher he would ever know. The same man responsible for his abduction at an early age from his birth family, and would be known to the children as Piper. The experimentation and pain of his upbringing is not one wished on any child, leaving a taste of blood in Kayn's mouth every time he thought of the man.
> 
> Kayn, and his "siblings", grew up like caged animals, being released from their prison only to be experimented on and for their father to test the outcomes of his work on unsuspecting townspeople. The majority of his siblings would not live to see the results of the experiments upon them, either dying during the process or burning up from the amount of arcane power coursing through their bodies without the constitution to resist; weeks or months of malnourishment or the tortures inflicted upon them leading to their bodies being torn apart and disintegrating, or combusting, at the first use of their power.
> 
> A few "lucky" children would survive the ordeal, but would rarely be kept in the same confines long enough for any of the other captives to learn much about the new found power. On occasion, an incident would bring terror or momentary joy to the dark and shabby confines the children found themselves in. Some would be able to summon fairy light to bring a small piece of playfulness to their companions. Others would be unable to control themselves and their arcane power would pour from them, harming or killing some of the surrounding children as a result. Kayn was one such child.
> 
> On his final day with the other children, shadow would start to seep from the stone recently placed on his arm. Unable to control it at this time, it would pool in his small confines before making its way into the neighbouring quarters of other children. It would smother them and Kayn would eventually be woken by the sensation of power flooding his body. He would follow the path of shadow that slipped through the cracks and crevices of the floor and between the bars that separated him from his neighbouring children. His eyes would fall upon little Orion's form in his cot writhing, feint screams coming from him. It would be Kayn's own screams of terror, pain and rage that would alert Piper to something happening with his test subjects.
> 
> After this, Kayn would never see his siblings again. Piper would pull him from the communal cages and take him to a solitary room. He would spend hours with Kayn, forcing him to focus his power with arcane words and movements to manifest it with intent. Kayn would attempt to do so to harm Piper occasionally, but each attempt was weak and barely bothered his teacher. If he disobeyed, he would either be punished with pain or left in complete isolation, an unnatural silence muffling every noise made within the room; it was an almost maddening experience, and only then pure bile inducing hatred of Piper would keep Kayn holding onto sanity.
> 
> After what could have easily been months, Kayn's training appeared to be ready to test. Piper would torture him constantly and would eventually start to spike his food with unknown substances that made Kayn almost delirious and volatile. The combination would regularly whip him into a rage and his powers would manifest in violent outbursts. It was during one of these spells that Kayn would one moment be within his dreary confines, and the next be in a small township. Finally, he had something to pour his rage into. 
> 
> Next he knew, Kayn was waking in the mud and rain. A almost deafening and eery silence surrounded him, as if every creature within miles had fled the area and even the wind had been cowed. Climbing to his feet on the edge of a town that now lay in pieces, bodies filling the street, Kayn would look on in horror at what he could only assume had been wrought at his hand. Without even a second's thought, his flight response kicked in and he ran as fast as his legs could carry him across the planes and into the cover of a nearby forest.
> 
> Days would pass, and the shock would fade, but its place would be quickly filled with a deep and seething rage that would see Kayn lash out with his arcane powers, blowing chunks out of unfortunate trees as he failed to control his emotions. In time, he would learn to take control and in his stumbling would eventually find his way into the city of Windfall.
> 
> There he would start to attempt to survive along the other homeless of the city. His powers made it possible for him to stay safe, and scavenge enough from alleys to live while defending himself from those who would look to take the meagre possessions he had. In time, he'd start to learn where to avoid and where to find an easy meal, where help could be found if he ended up hurt and where secret things that shouldn't be in the hands of the homeless might be uncovered. In the refuse of the city he would begin to find scraps of arcane knowledge thrown out by careless arcane users, and would spend his time piecing together the knowledge. He would be able to start making odds and ends that would help him; arcane firelights, methods of creating clean water for himself in small amounts, and would start to learn how to infuse a weapon with magic. Through all this, the fires of revenge, and the knowledge there were other children going through the same pain as he had, would fuel him day by day to get stronger.
> 
> In one of the rare occasions he had managed to scrimp enough coin together for a warm meal in a tavern, he would overhear conversation at a nearby table about a job in the nearby landscape. He would approach a tough looking human; stern of brow, thick and powerful muscles that looked like they'd been worked every day for thirty years, and a deep and grating voice that had obviously seen many years of loud raucous laughter in taverns or harsh shouting in command of others. Kayn offered his assistance in tracking the creature they were looking for in the surrounding woodland, hoping his knowledge would earn him a few coins to find a second night in the warm. The man would introduce himself as Brom and would be hesitantly and suspiciously taken up on his offer of help. 
> 
> In the course of their searching, they would fall foul of the dangers of the road and find themselves ambushed by a pack of creatures Kayn had never encountered, but that the adventurers obviously had. They formed up into quick ranks, and Brom pulled Kayn into form quickly and professionally keeping his flank guarded while obviously seeing what Kayn was made of. Obviously impressed by the grace and ease that Kayn moved between the creatures, he would be offered a temporary and trial basis with the group; his luck was finally starting to turn.
> 
> Brom would take Kayn under his wing, and would eventually sponsor his joining the Adventuring guild - [[The Windsinger's Collective]]. The guild, based out of an impressive building in the guildhalls of Windfall, would test his abilities, and though finding him a raw talent, decided Kayn was worth trialling. Brom would become his mentor, and Kayn his apprentice, a fact that would disgruntle a Dwarf by the name of Gorbrimdal who had been working to get noticed by Brom, a well known and respected figure within the [[The Windsinger's Collective|Windsingers]].
> 
> Eventually, Kayn would face his final test to join the guild. A feat of skill must be shown that would be deemed worthy by the panel of senior guildsmen and women. It was during this trial that Kayn would feel vibration within the crystal on his arm. He would allow it to flow through him, with some trepidation, and it would flow out of the crystal, down his arm, and would cover his blade in shadow and smoke. The blade would vibrate and almost begin to emit ethereal tones. He would challenge the crowd to an open duel. To Kayn's shock, Brom would accept the challenge.
> 
> Nerves bubbling inside him, the two agreed to terms of first blood. The bout would last only minutes, but in that time the room would be brought to a pindrop silence as they gawked at the grace and elegance exhibited by Kayn, and the pure skill and aggression of Brom. Ultimately, Kayn would lose this duel, with Brom's blade knicking his cheek as he ducked under a blow that would otherwise have cleaved him in two. After two heartbeats of the silence, where Kayn believed he could almost hear the drips of blood hit the wooden floor below him, the room erupted into cheers and celebration. The panel agreed that though he had been so outmatched in experience and class, the performance he had put on deserved a place amongst their number.
> 
> It would be Brom who would dub him the Light's Bane after this fight, as during the fight he could swear the stone wasn't just emitting shadow, but was also drawing the light in the ceremonial hall into it, and that once the competition had finished multiple people that had witnessed the combat had commented to him that they felt like they'd been focusing so much that the room brightened after.
> 
> Kayn would continue to learn from them, and gather power and knowledge for himself. He would never feel comfortable, however. Within him continued the lust for blood; even after years of working with the guild, the fury would occasionally bubble like the last day of his capture, and Kayn would decide he needed to take himself from the place before the fate of Orion befall one of the few friends he had finally been able to hold onto. Seeing the darkness within him, Brom would encourage the escape to try and bring himself some closure. Like a proud father, Brom would see his apprentice, now a fully fledged adventurer himself, off to the north.
> 
> It was in this period that he encountered a young Paladin claiming visions of a catastrophe in the mountains outside [[Liashton]] in a city of the Dwarves named [[Bal Toruhm]]. An explosion of that magnitude could only be caused by something with immense power. If he could bring a tenth of the power of this thing down on Pipers head, no matter how skilful the man, it would surely be his end.

## Class

## Physical Description
Slight build with wiry muscle, built for speed of movement over strength of arm. Covered in strong, dyed leather armour in blues, browns and creams, he strikes a cutting figure of sharp lines in his stance and face alike. Light brown hair, cut short on the left side and quiffed in waves to the right, it falls in well kept locks over a silver headband worn around his temple.

On his arms, however, are the stories of his early life. A mix of thick knotted and and fine and shallow scars cover his right forearm, each telling the tale of a new torture inflicted upon him. Just off-centre sits the smoky, obsidian-like, semi-transparent gemstone that glows softly with swirling shadow held inside.

Slightly under average height for a human, his stature speaks to one who's nimble feet get them in and out of a combat encounter quickly, while his keen and cutting brown eyes show the intelligence of someone who has forged their own path, putting themselves cunningly into the right place at the right time to take advantage of any opportunity.
