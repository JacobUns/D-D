The group is faced with a giant spider being ridden by a horde of ten or more goblins on a wooden platform squealing in excitement at the chance for prey. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] turns heel and runs before spinning and flinging off fireball, killing all but one goblin and singeing the spider and the remaining underboss. The spider charges down [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and spews web, restraining her. It flings the remaining goblin off its back towards [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] who takes a strike from the creature before hitting back with radiant power. More time passes as the battle continues, until [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] pierces the spider with her pike and a beam of radiant light incinerates it. As it blows apart, smaller spiders swarms out of the corpse and start to attack her.

As battle starts to slow, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] hears the sound of skittering from the dark in the distance and calls for the group to beat a hasty exit through the entryway across from them and towards their desired direction of travel. The group runs as fast as possible as [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] hears two spiders approaching from behind her.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]], not knowing how close the spiders are, continues running through the opposite entry as the spiders get within 20ft of [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]]. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] instinctively lets off a sorcerer's burst before yelling out to [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] that there are two more. [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] and [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] finally reach [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] at the building as Nix flies the opposite direction to scout. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] readies a twinned gaseous form as [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] runs towards the two hiding in the building. She casts Invisibility on herself through her ring and in a slight panic [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] triggers her cast on herself and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]]. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]], in confusion, is stunned for a few seconds while [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] attempts to take cover and hide, then goes to investigate what's happened to [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]], thinking she's outside. He sees that [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]], having clattered to the floor in an attempt to hide, appears to have made enough noise for the spiders to know where the group is. He positions himself above one of the spiders while Nix buzzes the other to cause a distraction and lead it off. The spider attempts to hit Nix with a web, and after initially missing, with Nix diving out of the way, eventually pins her to a wall and quickly dispatches her. A pang of pain cuts through the gaseous [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] as she passes.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] makes use of the gaseous form and explores the area while the group waits for the spiders to get some distance. Further into the residential area is a small square with a set of fairly large statues spotted around as a focal point to the area, but little else of interest appears to exist in the area. While waiting for [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] to recover, [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] expore a bit more. Judging by its size, the building appears to be a residence for one. The second floor is given over for a workroom with tools. A passage that appears to connect to another building connects to a bedroom and living quarters for another. Eventually, the two stumble across a communal area for food. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] recalls that, amongst dwarves, approximately a third of the population is female, and therefore would leave a lot of bachelors which this area appears to cater for.

The group heads down the residential path and across the statue garden and eventually reach an arch. It has the word "Deeps" on one side, and the other says "Western Gate", "[[Caves of Thistlebeard]]", "[[Vault of Tharbun]]", and "Uppers". Going down the latter path leads to a large hexagonal plaza with high vaulted ceilings and an intricately decorated floor. It appears somethings been trying to chip away at the floor and has removed gold from the dwarven face inlaid in the centre.

[[Vault of Tharbun]] off to the right
Left goes to Western Gate and [[Caves of Thistlebeard]].

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] mistranslates "[[Vault of Tharbun]]" as "Western Gate", and vise versa, for the others and forces the choice of [[Vault of Tharbun]].

Off the path are rooms, some looking war torn and others looking like they may have just been left but for the layer of dust. Ahead are sounds of voices in conversation, and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] creeps off to investigate. It reveals a grand room with a massive steel door. The symbol of an anvil with stars adorns the door and four people are standing in front of it discussing whether they "should try again", "should we wait", "ten people have gone in and no ones come out", etc. and then mention "the queen". [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]], therefore, assumes they're all [[hoarders]] and turns back to inform the others.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] casts a major image of the insignia on the groups forearms and then approach. After a quick back and forth, the [[hoarders]] figure out that the group aren't with them by asking "What have you got in your pockets?" and go to attack.
