Away from goblin village [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] sees some markings low down similar to the Dwarvish symbols. One near the goblin village we interpret to be danger, down the dwarven appears to be one that says safety.

Travel Checks
[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] uses ***History*** to remember how the dwarves set out their cities and direct us based on that - 24 #travelcheck 
[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] uses ***Nature*** to figure out where we're going based on the airflow and general makeup of the place - 15 #travelcheck 
[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] uses ***Perception*** to keep an eye out for anything that would indicate the direction we want to go - 10 #travelcheck 

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] checks a room and finds a former place of importance in the Deeps. Likely a grand location in its heyday, the room has fallen to disarray. We reach a crossroads, one path appears to go towards the deeps and we assume that's towards deeps 2. Two other paths lead off and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] notices that one of them is marked with a Dwarvish symbol that indicates safe. After noticing this, we notice the Deeps path has one that indicates unsafe.

Continuing on, we eventually reach a rectangular room with tall ceilings, mining equipment and minecarts with tracks leading off to the right. To the left is a square hole that goes up with chains hanging down. The platform appears to be dangling off one of the chains, the other of which has detached and curled on the floor in massive coils.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] climbs up the chain to investigate the platform while [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] attempt to position a minecart under the hole. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] sprains an ankle attempting to help and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]], once she reaches the bottom again, falls over trying to show off.

After getting the minecart in place, [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] casts levitate on it and the group float up to the top. After 300ft the group reach the top. After much debate on how to get the cart to the edge, [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] jumps out and [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] throws a rope over.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] searches the area to see if he can discern the purpose of the area, expecting to find coal or another type of material coming from a mine. He finds a crystal lodged near a minecart and pulls it out. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] feels some magic emanating, and after attempting to hone in on what it is finds that it's escaping him. After casting Detect Magic, the crystal glows faintly and digs up another.

Medium and Small chunk of mysterious crystal. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] starts to recall that he's seen the glow on an object before. He recalls someone with a small similar crystal that glowed claiming that it came from an Elven ruin. The group ruminate on whether the Dwarves may have been allied to the Elves and if so what that would mean for the world.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] uses ***Religion*** to request guidance from the Lightbringer - 8 #travelcheck 

With half a day of travel behind them, the group continues down the hall and see more signs of battle. They enter into a room with massive vaulted ceilings and large pillars, the room disappearing into darkness. It appears there were signs of dwarves falling back from this location, making a last stand from a great foe. There appear to be 2 dwarves for every goblin body. The group go down the edge of the room and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] sends Nix down the middle with mental instructions to return if she sees movement.

Nix flies off for a couple of minutes and returns. She relays there is an exit directly opposite and another large exit along the wall we're following. The wall is the longer path, and the group decides to risk crossing the darkness where Nix has reported a large hulking form moving in the shadows of the room. The creature hears the group, skuttles towards us, and in the dark we see a large spider with a goblin riding its back. The legs are covered in blades, and a platform on its back carries more goblins. They cackle as they see us and the one on the front wields a large cleaver in our direction.
