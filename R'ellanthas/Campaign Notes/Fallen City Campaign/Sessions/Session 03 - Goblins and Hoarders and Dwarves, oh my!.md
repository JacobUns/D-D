 [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] explains that she was taken from her parents at a couple of months old. She was taken to the monastery and referred to as "Oracle" from that point on. She lived there for 19 years, from that point on.

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] uses the first instance of Augury with [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]]'s question of "Would we find the source of the explosion by following the water?". The answer is "Wheel and Woe", leading to a neutral answer. The group investigate a bit to find possible exits and come to a crossroad.

At the crossroad, we find a sign pointing out of the cavern we are currently in, towards the west, saying "[[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|Citadel]] of the [[Dwarven Ringsmiths|Ringsmiths]]". The water flows into an area signposted as "The Deeps". [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] suggests that they go towards [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths]]. We continue down the paths and find a hexagonal room with signs for [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths]], The Deeps, Upper One, The Great Road, a Dwarven Town Name towards the "Keen Might" area, and "City of [[Bal Toruhm]]".

In travelling:
- [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] uses *Nature* to keep a better sense of the direction the group are going - 19 #travelcheck 
- [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] uses *Survival* to make sure there are no dangers or creature tracks in their path - 19 #travelcheck 
- [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] uses *Insight* to anticipate where there may be greater risk of ambush to the party, invoking [[Balinor]]'s protection and safe passage - 16 #travelcheck 

We find an arched corridor with cracked ceiling and believe they have been made recently. The corridor goes on and starts to reveal the grandeur of the place. There are multiple other breaks off from the path, but none are signposted. As we continue to pass little winding paths off our main route. It becomes clear this place is a maze. We get to an awe-inspiring area with artistically crafted rock, sculpted with care and attention. The rock feels glasslike, and the corners are sharp and precise. There's a curving and winding road that looks like it passes through what may have been a market. The floor is littered with decomposing corpses of goblin and dwarf-kind. Most are old, with some slightly more recent but still showing the age of time.

All manners of weaponry scatter the ground, not scavenged, but larger goblin forms resembling what must be an Orc creature join the piles. Picking through the bodies, something more powerful than an Orc but of approximately the same size appears to be in the piles. Darker green skin and thicker tusks, which [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] believes may be a Hobgoblin. [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] checks the bodies over, and believes some of the fresher corpses are about 5 years old. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]]'s checking over the bodies reveals webbing and drag marks away from it. There are strange bite marks of a scavenger or predator of a small creature's jaw. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] does her best to avoid any contact with the bodies.

Following paths up, the group travels a mile along another walkway off the market and see another corridor heading down. There are sounds of battle sounding from it; more shouts of goblins and deeper voices we don't recognise. [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] dashes off down the corridor before anyone can react.

8-10 Goblins with a boss harass a group of Dwarves. The goblins are quickly dispatched, with the Underboss shouting "Don't you know who I am?!" before he is pierced through the neck by [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] as he retorts "Evidentially not!". [[Tassora]], a female Dwarf in gleaming mithril plate armour, greets the group after checking whether we're "Hoarders", which apparently are a known entity in the dwarven fortress. She prods at the arms of the party looking for any wincing. With some kind of dexterity, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] manages to avoid any uncomfortable interactions around his right forearm, where the shadow billows when he casts. After a short trek, [[Tassora]] opens a wall with a ring she's wearing on her hand. She explains the city fell years ago, and that they haven't been able to get any messages out recently because their arcanely proficient comrade, Magdal, was in a dire way. [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] heals him with cure wounds and then heals another dwarven injured

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] attempts to beef up their reputation by lying about coming in the east entrance instead of the west. Using some detailed guessing of the size of the city, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] gives a convincing lie, but [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]]'s telling her that we came in yesterday foils the lie. She describes sending [[Amnur & Beldren]] towards [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths]]. She describes it as a major thoroughfare that's seen a lot of fighting over the years. She also describes that the goblin spider riders are thrown by their spider mounts as it bucks them off. The Hobgoblins seem to ride some kind of two legged lizard with large jaws and small arms.

The [[Hoarders]], she explains, are people praying on the Dwarves. The caverns used to be full of gold, mithril, armour and fine weaponry, but as the Dwarves fled to the outside, their boasting of riches within the mountain have resulted in the pillaging the spoils of the war. She explains they seem to speak of a [[Hoarder Queen]], and speaking of her in reverent ways. They have carved symbols into their arms that cause them to wince when they're poked. The [[Alliance of Vennar]], a group of cities that have formed a nation in the north east of the continent, also have members within the caverns. They have decided they're going to "sort out the city". The group agrees to rest with the dwarves. They say they haven't [[King Barmus Beruck]] in a year. Hoarders are believed to be in the deeps.

If we can help with the scouts, she will let us in on some of the dwarven secrets. She claims there's a rumour of a hidden passage at the back of the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|Citadel]] that can be opened with the rings they carry that opened the wall to this area.

The red eyes, we are told, were likely goblin scouts or at worst hobgoblins tracking us through the tunnels.
