The group is set upon by a group of goblins, including 2 snipers, 2 warriors and a group of goblin [[Homebrew Rules#Minions|minions]]. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] sleeps 3 of the targets, while [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] runs around with her pike alight skewering minions in their droves and proclaiming it as being on behalf of the light. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] shows his first use of magic by using his Blade Song and Shadow Blade combination. The 

Stretching into the distance of the opening is a long second entryway. The door we entered appears to be some kind of an anti-chamber for the great city. Down a path from the anti-chamber are an ornate set of doors. The walls are covered in goblin scrawling and nests. The nests seem to have been there a while, undisturbed. The nests seem to be fairly old and long bedded into. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] finds 6 dwarven gold pieces.

As we move down the passage, we find mirrors used to previously shed light from the surface. Something seems to have disrupted them, and the way is black ahead. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] casts dancing lights to give us some path to follow.

As we walk we see remnants that imply a battle took place here. Cracks run along the walls, and we reach an archway which reveals many levels, levers, pathways and sprawling cityscape of the dwarven city. Sound doesn't seem to echo in its travel, but the sight is awe inspiring. Crossing a bridge across an open expanse, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] notices, looking off the side, a set of small flames floating potentially a mile below. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] able to discern that they appear to be goblins riding large spiders. They don't look up or notice our lights, and eventually we move on.

After 4hrs of travel, and a number of noises that have caused us to stop, we have a feeling that something is aware we're there. Flashes of red light/eyes, shadows, and eye shine. Nothing comes of it, but it's unnerving.

Eventually, we come to a flooded district of the city. 2ft of water covers the ground, an aqueduct spilling water into the vast area. The walls are beautifully carved, and the water is fairly clear. It has very gentle movement, and implies that it flows somewhere into the distance. Moving into the water, the group investigates and finds a tall building that gives a good viewpoint. The building seems like it hasn't been disturbed in quite a while. Furniture is broken or rotten from being in the water. A shield hangs on the wall in the main room. The shield holds an insignia of the dwarven family that used to own the house. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] suggests casting something to read languages, and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] remembers he has a spell that allows that, and ritually casts Comprehend Languages.

The pillars contain runes that request a blessing from the god "Orag, the Hammer". The dwarven insignia says Keen Might - Dwarven family name. The insignia shows two hammers with heads coming together as a lighting bolt in the middle.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] takes the first watch, then [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]], and finally [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] after she declared "I'll take the first rest" before quickly falling asleep. During his watch, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] summons his dancing lights as a single ball near the water below and uses it as a lure to see if anything is prowling in the dark. Nothing stirs or interferes with it, and the remaining watches go uneventfully.
