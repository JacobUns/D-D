The group scout the area around the mansion for pathways that might represent that shown on the map. We continue past the mansion and find the corridor leading to a goblin tunnel that appears to disappear into the depths. The group discusses whether to continue on the path they had been or to explore the new path. After a discussion, they go down the goblin path which descends rapidly in a spiral. With a difficult descent, the group find they've dropped about 100ft rapidly further underground. The path levels off and eventually emerges back onto a dwarven corridor. To the right path is a rubble filled path that seems to connect onto another goblin path. To the left is a dwarven corridor with two humanoid figures approaching quickly. Nix buzzes past them and one attempts to throw a dagger which misses. She continues down the path as the group turn right.

Two rough and ready humanoids in cloaks and leathers, worn with age and use with functional footwear for sneaking. Both men, humans around 6ft, both have rapiers drawn. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] casts dancing lights above them, spot lighting them in place. They freeze in place and we exchange words. They put their swords away and the groups convene in the middle.

The men identify as hoarders though they don't like the name, and go by the name Sebar and Brif. Both wear goggles that appear to be for seeing in the dark. [[Dohma Rashkovar]] is the boss of this area and is in a trading post located in a goblin village down the right path. [[Dohma]] doesn't really have friends, they claim.

Gold coin with a rough female figure wearing a fancy hat is the symbol of the hoarders. It's the visage of what is believed to be the Hoarder Queen, but no one's seen her to know if it's correct. Its branded on their arm and would have been what the dwarves were looking when we found [[Tassora]]'s band.

Deep 2 is an outpost for the hoarders, and if someone wants to join then they can be found a half day's travel from our current position. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] threatens them one final time, and they decide to take their chances. Battle ensues, with the group floundering slightly and the hoarders getting a few hits in. The two are killed, with Brif's head being exploded with light by [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]].

The two have on them:
2x Goggles of Night - Kayn & Maria
Potion of Healing - Kayn
Potion of Healing Superior - Kayn
Bottle with the go faster stripe - Bold Bottom's Boutique (Haste) - "Do not use on animals" - Maria

Scroll of Ice Knife - Oh
Scroll of Faerie Fire - Oh
Scroll of Spiritual Weapon - Oh

Two +1 Swords - Kayn

The group agree to set up camp for a night and to follow the left path to find a safe place. The first exit off the corridor is an aqueduct with water pouring into the room. Looks like it was once a water drawing location that's seen much better days. An area of it appears to have been fortified and stripped of anything useful.

Message [[Tassora]], she has heard of [[Dohma]]. He's an orc that heads up the area of the goblin's territory. She's sending [[Amnur & Beldren]] to scout. If we carried on down the dwarven tunnel, we would likely assume we're in Deep 1. Before we sleep, [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] communes with the gods and asks whether if we continue down the dwarven path whether we'd reach the eastern side of the city. The gods give a neutral response, which we interpret to mean that it may or may not be able to access the path, but probably not from this specific corridor.

The group hunker down in one of the side rooms for a long rest. [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] takes the first watch, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] the second and [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] the third. On [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]]'s watch, goblins are heard coming down path. Lots of feet pass by the corridor towards the goblin village without investigating the room as the group sleeps.
