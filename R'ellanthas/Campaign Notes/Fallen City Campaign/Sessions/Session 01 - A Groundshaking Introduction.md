Game starts at [[Liashton]] sitting in the middle of the [[Lake Liash]] near the dwarven city of [[Bal Toruhm]], the great city.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] Travelling through the [[Enlightened Kingdom]] come to the entry to the town across a wooden bridge that sways with the water. Loose guard of town watch at the arched ceremonial gates to the town.

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] & [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]], late teens
[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] - Blue Genasi, moves purposeful and graceful
[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] - Human in large and loose fitting armour

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] had been waiting at the gates for a couple of days

Head towards the centre to find a nice joint for the area called [[The Lady's Inn]] to get a drink. 

Barmaid gives information about [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] after a silver bribe. Seems to think she's of some importance. Never seems short of coin.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] is from Ravenfarm, south of the [[Enlightened Kingdom]].

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]]'s premonition is that of the continuation of a calamity. [[Pantheon of R'Ellanthas#The Sovereign Host|The Sovereign Host]] has provided visions of the [[Lake Liash]], the town of [[Liashton]], and our entry into her story. The calamity then starts shortly after. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]]'s vision never takes place inside the town.

Pointed towards the dock where there are always people in need of odd jobs.

Nix - Greater Sooty Owl Familiar

Find 3 dwarves unloading intricately carved boxes into a stall
Boat unloading some barrels of fish
Sheep being pulled towards

Approach the three dwarves, two doing the hard work. Another, with a really long platted beard and decorated with gold and silver jewellery woven in. Baled, old dwarf. The other two, one male one potentially female, are younger.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]]'s armour is her father's which she's inherited. Dwarf pays with a dwarven silver coin, clearly marked as such.

Bone rattling explosion rips through the town as the mountain a couple of miles away, as the top of the mountain disappears in a tower of ash. Rocks and boulders starts to pelt the town, with [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] realising what's going on while [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] is taken by surprise.

A fine mist of dusty starts to obscure our vision within the town as we run through the city, being pelted with rock. The city is in disarray, paths missing from destruction, people covered in dust and ash. An eery silence starts to descend upon the town. [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] runs to help those that are injured, [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] starts cleaning people off and providing them clean water. The dwarf starts to help with the triage while [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] discusses.

Dwarves have been in battle for hundreds or thousands of years. Some have had enough and have left to the surface. The under-dwarves new city, [[Gomlodir]].

Entrance on either side of the dwarven city. Left crossroads takes you towards [[Gomlodir]], the path straight takes you to the western gate of [[Bal Toruhm]], southern path to the right goes towards [[Thomyar]]. Door hasn't been opened in centuries. Southern path leads off to another location we're not told about.

Nix flying above starts to see the sun after an hour. Very scarred mountainside, but mostly the top that's been blown off. Top 3rd of the mountain has been destroyed, and knowing this is not of volcanic nature, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] comes to understand that this is likely not a natural explosion. No lava, steam or other such external factors are visible, leading [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] to believe that it's not natural in nature.

Walkway back to the shore is destroyed, and we jump in a boat rowed by one of the locals. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] jumps out quickly after and [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] pays 5g to the boatman who quickly pockets the funds. [[Liashton]] seems to have come away fairly well for the potential damage, and a dwarven road leads up towards the mountain.

The road heads towards a cliff face, and the road either goes up a steep set of stairs up a couple hundred meters. Another goes up in switchbacks carved into the stonework the likes of which we've never seen before. The road is damaged and obstructed by boulders.

Set off up the stairs towards the summit after sending Nix up to scope out the route. She identifies 1 part has been destroyed in the aftermath.

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] describes the process of the enchanted steps to her audience chamber. If the gods judge the question as unworthy then they can make the journey longer. If they favour the question, they can make the pathway shorter.

Entrance to [[Bal Toruhm]] is 6 stories tall with two massive dwarven figure statues on either side standing guard. The explosion seems to have blocked the path of a flowing river and is now starting to form a lake. One of doors has a massive crack running from top to bottom and the area looks much like a wasteland

We reach the full entrance with a courtyard in front of it. There appears to be a side entrance, and oddly it seems to have been barred from the outside and locked. Signs written in multiple languages, including common, say "Keep out, not safe for visitors". The door is barricaded from the outside with all manner.

Goblin's fire on the group as the door is opened.
