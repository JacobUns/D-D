The battle commences, and the troll strides through the door with a swarm of goblins. The battlelines are drawn, with six Dwarves holding the door with [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]], and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] tackling the Troll with 4 other Dwarves. Through the course of the fight [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] takes substantial damage from the troll charging him down, but is healed by a combination of [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]].

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] kills 20-30 goblins w/ Fireballs, and ends up catching a Dwarf on the edge of the range. The Dwarf fails its Dex save and takes substantial damage, but is then swarmed by goblins and falls.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] battles through and heals the dwarf towards the end of the battle, recovering it from death's door. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] finally, with the aid of the Wildfire Ring he picked up as his reward from [[Tassora]], fells the Troll. All goblins, bar one Cursespitter which escapes into the dark, are felled with no Dwarven causalities.

Following the battle, [[Tassora]] commands and directs Dwarves into action to secure the halls of the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|Citadel]]. During a lull, the group decide to introduce [[Tassora]] to [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]]. She provides information on what's happened to the Dwarves in the time since his last interaction with anyone in the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]]. 

[[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]], over the span of a few months, will provide his tutelage. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] intends to provide an apprentice tutelage of his own as he learns to be able to provide a source of manufacture while the group aren't with the troop.

[[Tassora]] provides information that [[King Barmus Beruck]] was last seen in the King's Hall, deep in the east caverns which would be two days travel if the city weren't underseige. Based on this, the group estimates that it's at least double this plus additional time spent in areas along the way. This means it's likely two weeks travel there and back, which seems to start worrying [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]].

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] claims to have found out some information on how the oracles are handed over to the new Oracle before leaving. The Oracle is invested at birth with the divine power, and [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] has discovered that a new Oracle has already been born. She believes that those responsible for the oracles have not chased her to find her, as they know that their new devotee will be replacing [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]]. She understands that an Oracle doesn't typically live past a year after a new oracle comes of age.

[[Tassora]] plans to shore up and reinforce the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]] walls, defences and doors. She provides us the names and locations within half a day's travel that may have dwarf resistance we can look to recruit and/or return to the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]] to build a greater number to defend the location.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] spends time with [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] to learn some smithing and artificery while [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] help with the reinforcement of the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]] to become defensible.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] claims to have found her flag in a cave, and believes it to be a lost artefact from the battle of Rogueport. Following the battle, Paladins recovered shipments of silk from the "southern barbarians", which we come to learn is how the empire appear to refer to those from Oda. The shipments were of Sinkarin silk from Oda, a rare and expensive material made by the Oda family. Few families, including the Barragond, Sracosa and Throns families, would know the secrets behind crafting this silk, and so it would become a major source of wealth for the Oda family.

It doesn't look like Silk, but a more matt finish, and the secret of how it's made is very closely guarded. A minor magic appears to be imbued upon the material during crafting, and though it doesn't shine like a magical item would it is clear it is not a natural substance. As a result, it doesn't stain easily and therefore requires a skilled hand to work it into items for sale. White, close to its natural colour state, is the cheapest variant while variants that require heavy dye treatments to obtain a uniform tone, such as Black or Red, are the most expensive.

The flag retrieved by [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] probably cost between 10k and 15k gold to the right buyer. It is emblazoned with the White tower of the Enlightened Empire with two Paladins either side, looking like they're coming to its defence. At the best guess, the flag was made in commemoration of the battle, using the spoils of war as a trophy of their victory to flaunt over their foes from the battle.

In the process of the group's sharing information about themselves, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] is asked by [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] where he's from. He answers honestly that he doesn't really know, and provides them information on his torturous upbringing at the hands of Piper. He plainly shows them the 4 inch by 1.5 inch length of almost obsidian like smoky gemstone that appears to have been fused into his arm. He shows the extensive scarring of his arm and explains that when his powers started to manifest that he was let loose on an unsuspecting town, but that he blacked out early and woke alone in a smouldering town. [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] asked whether Piper was looking for him, and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] honestly replied he doesn't know; he simply ran when he came to consciousness. He claims he doesn't know how hold he is, as he was taken as at a very young age, but estimates he's now somewhere between mid twenties to early thirties.
