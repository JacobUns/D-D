Bookcase holds books with fancy chained books behind a large stone desk

Some of the unlocked books have an autobiography for each of the [[Dwarven Ringsmiths|ringsmiths]], and contains diagrams of fine mundane artificary. Some of the books appear to be written in Elvish, and may contain the secrets of magical artificary. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] successfully unlocks one of the books from it's wall and picks the lock. Before being able to read much of the content, he hears a voice creeping from the dim room behind him.

Wearing the garb of the [[Dwarven Ringsmiths|Ringwright]], a Dwarven ethereal figure wearing ceremonial leathers and equipped with smithing tools calls out. [[Gulnur, the Ringwright]], chastises [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] for intruding on their sacred knowledge. After some back and forth, where [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] claims they are there to help the dwarves and nothing else, [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] claims that the knowledge held in the books is for only the worthy of crafting in the halls of the [[Dwarven Ringsmiths|Ringsmiths]].

[[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] tells [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] that he must prove his ability is of a high enough standard to access the books, or [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] would kill him for intruding on the secret knowledge. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] manages to persuade [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] that he has the ability to do so, but that he doesn't have any of it with him currently and so can't show [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] his craftsmanship. After a quick bit of cunning, [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] persuades [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] to let him craft something for [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]] with his guidance.

The group settle down for the night and prepare themselves for the day ahead. In the morning, and after preparing themselves accordingly, they hear the pounding on the door. Magdal sets up a glyph of warding near the door, while the remaining dwarves, [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] all hide around the edges of the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]] entrance while [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] decides to stand in the open, on a mound of rubble, acting as bait.
