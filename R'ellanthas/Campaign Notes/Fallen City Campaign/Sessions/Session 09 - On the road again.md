Crafting complete on mundane - 10 roll, created a passable but not fine item. Will probably require a new item to be crafted to use in future crafting.

Will finding the king benefit us? Wheel
Would seeking out the goblin tunnels help us find the source of the explosion? Wheel

Approach [[Tassora]], tell her the King is still living
She calls over [[Amnur & Beldren]] and they give us information
Split east and west with a road in the middle
We're currently west, and the largest part of the whole city of [[Bal Toruhm]] is on the eastern side
The king's hall is on the eastern side
Places of interest along the way include the Upper Mines, [[Caves of Thistlebeard]], [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], [[Vault of Tharbun]], [[Fortress of Malech]], [[King's Hall]] along the ground level.
They are aware of the [[Mountain Galleries]] but they are in the upper levels, but are not sure what states they are in as they haven't been explored.

Vault rumoured to be that of a dwarf called Tharbun who had quite the treasure hoard. His winding vault maze filled with various traps and magical defences keep people.

[[Caves of Thistlebeard]] were created by one of the earliest kings within a natural cavern. It was made into a grand park. Mushrooms the size of great trees and moss that covers the area. [[Caves of Thistlebeard|The Caves]] hold a tomb of the king that created it.

The connection road is almost a dead straight road between east and west. They have no idea what might be along the path and what may have taken up residence there, but they also say it connects off to other caves and chambers as a main thoroughfare. It is gated at either end with massive archways. The gate on the west side is approximately halfway along our travel.

[[Tassora]] agrees to lend us [[Amnur & Beldren]] for half a day to set us on our way.

[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] asks the gods whether the west gate is open on the Great Road between West and East. Woe response.

They lead the way out of the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|Citadel]] from the secret path in the library. It's a long snaking path with no other exits. It leads to a stone door at the end with the dwarves listen against before pulling it open. It leads to a two-dwarf wide tunnel. Left takes us back to the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]], right goes deeper. We go right, with [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] casting twinned Darkvision on [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]]. 

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] uses ***Animal Handling*** on Nix to help her look out for any dangers - 23 #travelcheck
[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] uses ***Investigation*** to lookout for any homemade Goblin traps - 22 #travelcheck
[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] uses ***Performance*** to pretend she knows what's she's doing with confidence - 7 #travelcheck 

Along the way, reliefs of dwarven figures carved in stone line the halls. Some have been defaced by the goblins. The path leads to a vaulted hall that may have been used as a market space where we are able to find rations. The corridor breaks into a further hall with an arched doorway. Beautifully chiselled, the dwarves have carved intricate patterns into them. The hall would have been a gathering hall, home to great feasts and debates before the fall of the city. Used both for games and ceremony, the hall holds massive tables that have been splintered and stone chairs that have fallen to decay. The walls are natural, but regularly there are statues of important dwarves with plaques describing who they were and why. The hall has markings that are dedicated to [[Pantheon of R'Ellanthas#Orag, the Hammer|Orag, the Hammer]], as well as markings to [[Pantheon of R'Ellanthas#Yotid, the Anvil|Yotid, the Anvil]], across the statues of the dead dedicating themselves in death. There is some evidence of goblin usage within the halls, but nothing recent. Remains of camps, bones from meals, and some corpses of the fallen.

[[Amnur & Beldren]] take their opportunity at this point to leave us to our travels.

[[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] uses ***Religion*** to seek guidance from the gods - 10 #travelcheck 
[[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] uses ***Survival*** to continue trying and act confidently - 3 #travelcheck 
[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] uses ***Stealth*** to keep the group quite in their travels - 18 #travelcheck 

Through the difficulties of travel, we eventually reach a residential area. It seems pretty ancient in its construction and appearance. Residences surround a 3-story building in the middle of the area with a water feature. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] sends Nix out to flyby the house and see whether she can see more. Inside, the she sees a large green creature wearing some kind of armour, solid mail, shield and weapon. We assume its an Orc with some Goblins in the house.

The group dispatch the goblins and orc. Searching the orc, he has 10gp and has a piece of parchment with the following message, "Brog, take some Spinecleavers and go to The Butchers Mansion and hold the path. Dohma". The group decides to search the building and find something that appears to be a goblin den. Any furniture or artwork has been smashed and destroyed, and it appears to have been completely pillaged and overrun. On the second floor, [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] finds a crudely drawn map on the wall. It depicts a main tunnel, with 3 tunnels that leave the main tunnel. On the end of the first tunnel is a depiction of what appears to be the butchers mansion. On the other end of the tunnel is a quiggly tunnel that goes down to a circular chamber. The circular chamber has an arrow pointing to it with the initials "DR".
