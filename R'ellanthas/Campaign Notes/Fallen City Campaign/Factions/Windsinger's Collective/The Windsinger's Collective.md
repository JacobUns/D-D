# About
Based in Windfall, this group is made up of professional adventurers for hire. The guild are a contract organisation that service the kingdoms, duchies and empires around the continent. Priding themselves on their ability to complete all manner of quests and needs, from slaying of troublesome creatures, escort of important caravans or master craftsmanship for ceremonial needs, the Windsinger's have gained some renown for their track record.

The guild get their name from their founder, centuries ago, by a legendary adventurer known as *Aeloria Windsinger*. A wandering bard with the ability to manipulate the very winds with her voice, *Aeloria's* songs could calm storms, summon gentle breezes, and even carry her voice across vast distances.

Inspired by the power of wind and song to unite people, she traveled far and wide, bringing together outcasts, scholars, warriors, and mages who shared a passion for exploration and discovery. After saving a kingdom from a devastating tempest, Aeloria was given a place in Windfall to form a guild of like-minded individuals to gather, learn from one another, and embark on adventures that would shape the world's future. Her name became synonymous with the guild’s ideals of freedom, harmony, and the pursuit of knowledge, and her spirit still lingers in the winds that carry adventurers to distant lands, making her the eternal "Windsinger" of the Collective.

To join, a member must show their skill or proficiency in a skill that will benefit the guild. Usually, as an adventuring guild, this would be in combat, but the group will also accept people with exceptional skill, in a craft or word, that will see the guild better equipped to accomplish any kind of quest they may embark upon.
