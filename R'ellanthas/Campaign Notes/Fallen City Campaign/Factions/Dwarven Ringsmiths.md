# About
The dwarves are known for their craftsmanship, whether it be in stonework, natural materials of metal and gem, or the infusion of such materials with the arcane. The Ringsmiths are the masters of their crafts within the great city of [[Bal Toruhm]].

Their craft has developed over thousands of years under the tutelage of [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|Gulnur]], a master craftsman who would come to be known as [[Gulnur, the Ringwright|the Ringwright]]. He would be the figurehead of an organisation that would create works of great skill, all documented and stored in the library of the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|Ringsmith's Citadel]], and would mentor new generations of craftsmen.
