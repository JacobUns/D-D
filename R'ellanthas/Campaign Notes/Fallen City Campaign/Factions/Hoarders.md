# About
A faction of treasure hunters and opportunist, the Hoarders are the scavengers of [[Bal Toruhm]]. Taking the opportunity that the war between Goblins and Dwarves has presented, the Hoarders pick through the remains of the broken and war torn cityscape for anything worth coin.

The group are not specifically allied with any one side, but as the city of [[Bal Toruhm]] is Dwarven their relationship with the Dwarves is fractious. The Dwarves believe the group a scourge, pilfering their relics and treasures, and so are weary of accidentally allowing one into their camps.

The group is headed by the matriarchal figure of the [[Hoarder Queen]], a mysterious figure that hasn't been seen by those that follow her and so none know her appearance. 

Her appearance is depicted on the symbol of the Hoarders, a coin that has been minted with the figure of a woman wearing a large hat, her face shaded. The insignia is usually placed on the forearm of member as a brand.
