Heading down the medium sized corridor, the group isn't the most stealthy. The footsteps echo down the corridor making the group somewhat paranoid about being heard. Nix alerts at the sight of cobwebs around the edges of the corridor, and then again at the sight of a cobweb covered entryway. [[Amnur & Beldren|Beldren]] and [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] creep closer to the entryway while the remaining group hang back towards the point at which the cobwebs start to cover the edges of the cavern.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] plucks some of the web on the floor after [[Amnur & Beldren|Beldren]] points out a figure in the distance with legs hanging over the edge of the cave entrance. The shadowy figure of a massive spider quickly starts skittering down the corridor towards the group. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] and [[Amnur & Beldren|Beldren]] back up to get closer to the group whilst casting Grease to trip the spider on its approach. The spider slips and falls prone, and the group pounce.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] dispatches the first giant spider, but two more quickly skitter their way towards the group. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] dispatches the second, and [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] the third with the group seeing some of the skills of the spiders including web snares. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] scavenges some of the fangs and venom from the dead spiders while [[Oh, Air Genasi|Oh]] clears some of the webbing with elemental effects on the pathway up. [[Maria Ravenloft|Maria]] takes a massive swing to cut through the webbing and reveals a drop of 40ft over a cavern of white marble crafted beautifully. The room is staggeringly beautiful, a huge hall several hundred feet long and a hundred feet wide. The ceiling opens into an arched & domed roof.

Black Marble pillars rise to a height of 80 feet. 7 great thrones at the end of the hall in a staggered formation sit around a small shiny Mithral plinth. Several small chambers lead off the sides, and sprawling across the floor are the remains of dead creatures and remnants of battle. 30-40 Goblins, a few spiders and Rotund Goblin sits on the centre throne. The other two tunnels join onto the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]] at different levels and a sizable tunnel off the back of the hall seems to slope downwards.

The group returns to [[Tassora]] with [[Amnur & Beldren]] to align and gather reinforcements to return to the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]]. We fill [[Tassora]] in on the scouting report and the inside of the [[The Citadel of the Ringsmiths|citadel]] and form a plan.

Check the outside is barricaded by the goblins
Travel down the medium tunnel
Barricade front door if it's not
Collapse the new corridor ways in
Attack the main force
Allow [[Amnur & Beldren]] to collapse the entry down
Leave 2 dwarven lookout at the entryway to collapse

Trolls
Weakness to Fire and Acid
Good sense of smell
Not very wise
