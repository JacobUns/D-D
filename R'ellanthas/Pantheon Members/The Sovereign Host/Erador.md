Genderless in writings, referred to by name or as a prime rather than a gendered pronoun. Depicted by artisans, artists and sculptors as male. This is assumably due to the nature of biology rather than any anthropological reasoning. As the antithesis of [[Arawai]], it stands to reason the [[#Deity]] would be depicted as male.

Due to their genderless representation in sacred texts, there are depictions of both [[Arawai]] and Erador as both male and female depending on their creator's beliefs. The Great Council seem to have shown their beliefs through the depictions chosen to be represented in the temples of major cities.

Imagery rarely shows the [[#Prime|prime's]] face, rather opting for a battle ready depiction with a range of weaponry, from bows to glaives and swords.
