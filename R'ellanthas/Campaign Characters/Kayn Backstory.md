# Backstory
Known only by [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]], a name given to him by the closest father figure and teacher he would ever know. The same man responsible for his abduction at an early age from his birth family. The experimentation and pain of his upbringing is not one wished on any child, leaving a taste of blood in [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]]'s mouth every time he thought of the man.

[[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]], and his "siblings", grew up like caged animals, being released from their prison only to be experimented on and for their father to test the outcomes of his work on unsuspecting townspeople. The majority of his siblings would not live to see the results of the experiments upon them, either dying during the process or burning up from the amount of arcane power coursing through their bodies without the constitution to resist. Weeks or months of malnourishment or the tortures inflicted upon them leading to their bodies being torn apart and disintegrating or combusting at the first use of their power.

A few "lucky" children would survive the ordeal, but would rarely be kept around long enough for any of the other children to learn much about their new found power. [[Kayn, Light's Bane|Kayn]] was one of such children.
