Genderless in writings, referred to by name or as a prime rather than a gendered pronoun. Depicted by artisans, artists and sculptors as Female. This is assumably due to the nature of childbirth being a form of creation among mortals making for a more relatable representation.

Due to their genderless representation in sacred texts, there are depictions of both Arawai and [[#Erador]] as both male and female depending on their creator's beliefs. The Great Council seem to have shown their beliefs through the depictions chosen to be represented in the temples of major cities.
