# World Theology
## History
The history of the pantheon is fairly well established and agreed amongst theologians of the council. Priests and Temple officials from across the continent gathered after the Ending War to identify the doctrine that would be permitted following the fall of Elves and Dragons, ensuring any teachings that may have contributed to this war over millennia would not come to be taught again. As a result, following the Ending War the council, through their actions, implied two groups of deities; They would come to be known as [[#The Sovereign Host]] and [[#The Dark Six]].

Throwing their full resources behind The Sovereign Host, the council employed architects, builders guilds, craftsmen and their chosen officials to begin tearing down the iconography of those gods and idols of the elves and dragons, replacing them with sanctioned iconography.

The Temple Priests would begin to teach the history of the pantheon in their own ways, and over the next few centuries would develop disparate methods, tenants, stories and environments for worship. All share the same creationism story premise with varying details that have evolved over centuries, which begins with [[#The Genesis]].
### The Genesis
Two powers, in perfect balance. The [[#Prime]] forces of the multiverse; [[#Arawai]], the beginning of all things, and [[#Erador]], the creeping end existed like a snake eating its own tail. For eons they evenly balanced each other; an infinite game where every move one made the other countered in a perfect stalemate. Each [[#Prime]] driven to continue the directive it had been imbued with, not knowing or caring where these impulses to create and destroy originated. Until something changed, the events of which would come to be known as The Genesis.

[[#Arawai]] and [[#Erador]] came to an accord. [[#Arawai]] would be allowed to create something new with the help of [[#Erador]], but the help would come at the cost of the ultimate end of each living entity. With this agreement in place, the two [[#Prime|Primes]] would spend millennia designing all things. Their creations spanned and overlapped in space and time, growing more complex with each creation until the two found themselves stretching their capabilities.

The more the two created, the harder they found it to stay balanced. Some theologians theorise that this is seen in the lifespan of certain races or creatures, where as others believe the cause of this stems from divine blood. Others still believe races with longer lives may have made pacts with the gods, and others angered them.

Whatever the cause, the [[#Prime|Primes]] agreed to separate some of their power into beings with the power and responsibility to govern their creations in certain Domains. The first born of the [[#Prime|Primes]] were [[#Aureon]], goddess of Order and Justice, [[#Dol Arrah]], goddess of Light, [[#Olladra]], goddess of Fate, and [[#Balinor]], god of beasts.

The first-generation of [[#Deity|deities]] were created with equal amounts of power from both [[#Prime|primes]]. In this, they were able to operate without the oversight of their parents. [[#Olladra]], [[#Erador]]'s favourite, would come to ensure that all would end as she weaved the creations of her parents and siblings into a tapestry only visible to her eyes, carefully curating the end of each creation.
### The Second Generation
As their children designed and created, the [[#Prime|Primes]] found themselves turning back in their eternal game. Though they continued to fill their multiverse with new and ever more complex creations, they soon found themselves envious of their children's ability to operate without a balancing force acting against them. Slowly, their behaviour became more extreme ultimately leading the two to conflict. Eventually, [[#Aureon]] would come to suggest
### The Corruption
### The Ascension
### The Shattering
[[#Olladra]] leads the shattering of their parents having planned an end to further conflict between the two. During the conflict, the secret elven child of [[#Melorkis]] seizes the opportunity to usurp the place of [[#Olladra]]. The temples associated with [[#Olladra]] teach that this was part of the tapestry, but other theologians and teachings preach that [[#Malis]] tainted the child seeing the potential [[#The Dark Six]] to gain more of a foothold in the pantheon.

### Common Divine Powers
## The Sovereign Host
The Sovereign Host are well recognised and respected gods followed by the masses of society. They are openly practised and temples holding idols or iconography of worship to one or more of these pantheon members are common in many cities.

### Arawai
Genderless in writings, referred to by name or as a prime rather than a gendered pronoun. Depicted by artisans, artists and sculptors as Female. This is assumably due to the nature of childbirth being a form of creation among mortals making for a more relatable representation.

Due to their genderless representation in sacred texts, there are depictions of both Arawai and [[#Erador]] as both male and female depending on their creator's beliefs. The Great Council seem to have shown their beliefs through the depictions chosen to be represented in the temples of major cities.
### Aureon
Depicted as Female
### Balinor
Depicted as Male
### Boldrei
Depicted as Male
### Dol Arrah
Depicted as Female
### Dol Dorn
Depicted as Male
### Erador
Genderless in writings, referred to by name or as a prime rather than a gendered pronoun. Depicted by artisans, artists and sculptors as male. This is assumably due to the nature of biology rather than any anthropological reasoning. As the antithesis of [[#Arawai]], it stands to reason the [[#Deity]] would be depicted as male.

Due to their genderless representation in sacred texts, there are depictions of both [[#Arawai]] and Erador as both male and female depending on their creator's beliefs. The Great Council seem to have shown their beliefs through the depictions chosen to be represented in the temples of major cities.
### Kol Korran

### Olladra

## The Dark Six
The Dark Six are well recognised, but often aligned with evil and therefore are socially frowned upon. It is rare for these gods to be worshipped openly in many major cities, but shrines and small temples can still be found in more rural areas. This is especially true of The Fury and The Traveller, as many argue these are not inherently evil paths. Still, these deities are often revered behind closed doors, or by cults, rather than the general population.

## Dwarven
As one of the factions that did not involve themselves in the formation of the council, the dwarves claim to have their own pantheon. World Theologians believe these to be the same pantheon of gods, simply known by different names. This is disputed by the Dwarves due to the nature of their worship being different to those gods of the council.

To anyone outside of the dwarven culture, the pantheon represented and worshipped by the dwarves is a topic of some disdain; the dwarves do not draw a line between The Dark Six and The Sovereign Host, worshipping each in their own right, which causes much unrest in the council and its theologically advisors.

#### The Silver Flame
#### The Path of Light
### Dead Faiths
#### Draconic
##### Gods
It is theorised that Gods or Idols created by [[#Arawai]]'s power, but as worship of the Draconic faiths has fallen to disrepute so too has the common knowledge of who or what these [[#Deity|deities]] may have been. Scraps of history shared by the Arcandor Academy seem to indicate at least one name of a Draconic [[#Deity]]; Vol, the Deathless Martyr. It is secretly theorised that [[#Erador]] may have had a hand in the creation of a new god with [[#Arawai]], and that they therefore may continue to exist.
##### Faiths
With the destruction of the Draconic race during The Ending War, the faiths associated were banned from being practised by the races that remained. Any worship of these faiths is subject to discipline by the Guardians of Il'Mondum.

###### Cults of the Dragon Below
Lost to time, the Arcandor Academy have released the rhetoric on the existence of cults that idolise a creature only known as The Dragon Below. It is believed that this Draconic being gained enough of a following during The Ending War to become a minor [[#deity]] in its own right.

Nothing in the history and writings discovered indicates whether this creature is alive or not, and occasionally the Guardians of Il'Mondum are sent to obscure locations with little to no explanation which some rumour is to combat the Dragon Below which still lives. The Arcandor Academy has been known to say that there is no verifiable evidence of this being the case, and these are likely drunken stories at the bar told by those who have had too much to drink and not enough sense.
#### Elven
With the destruction of the Elven race during The Ending War, the faiths associated were banned from being practised by the races that remained. Any worship of these faiths is subject to discipline by the Guardians of Il'Mondum.

###### The Raven Queen
Little is known about the origins of The Raven Queen, but within the right circles it is believed that she was a demi-god born of [[#Melorkis, The Shadow]].

Her depiction as Elven and association with the Elven religions pre-Ending War has resulted in the worship of The Raven Queen being banned by The Great Council even though some teachings associated to Olladra indicate that she was usurped. The Temples to [[#Olladra]] setup by The Great Council claim she was not [[#Usurpation|usurped]], but was instead [[#Shattered]] and managed to reform after extensive time. This is a hole in teachings that sits uncomfortably for many scholars, but few are willing to openly criticise the teachings for fear of punishment under the Guardians of Il'Mondum.

###### The Undying Court
It is believed that Onatar bore children by the elves, leading to their exceedingly long lives and exquisite craftsmanship. Their association to the goddess led to worship among the elves as Idols in their own right. It is unknown by the world whether these idols still exist in secret, hoarding their power, or whether they too were wiped out during the Ending War.

## Champions
The deities of the world have rarely been seen in the material plane since [[#The Shattering]]. Most believe these to be myths and fairy tales told to children by the orders of clerics and schools of bards. There rumours in the right theological circles that each of the gods has their own champion, imbued with minor amounts of the [[#Deity|Deity's]] power to enact their will on the material plane. These agents are argued to enable the gods to act against each other without making themselves vulnerable.

# Keywords
### Ascendant
Mortal creatures can become [[#Deity|Deities]] by bestowal of power by one of the existing pantheon. Doing so delegates the mortal a portion of its own raw power in the same way as for [[#Emergent]] [[#Deity|Deities]]. Ascendency is, therefore, mythical in nature when discussed by mortals. Due to the nature of ascendancy, the mortal becomes immortal and part of the energy that makes up the planes.
### Corrupted
Given enough time and the correct knowledge, the gods have been known to be able to affect each other in various ways. Theologians posit that this requires them to imbue the deity with some of their energy to do so, making the imbued deity more powerful and themselves less powerful. Teachings from the temple talk of the events of [[#The Corruption]] as the only major event of a [[#Prime]] affecting multiple deities at once. Other teachings talk of corruption being used for revenge or divine politics.
### Deity
An immortal manifestation of power. It is created with certain responsibilities and domains as decided by the creator. Usually, this is done when a deity loses interest in the domain, and create a deity who embodies the very nature of that domain to serve as its keeper and protector.
### Emergent
Emergent gods are "born" of the power bestowed upon them by their "parent". In sacrificing some of their power, they leave themselves weaker and vulnerable to their counterparts. As a result, deities are typically created in cohorts to ensure equilibrium.

[[#Deity|Deities]] other than [[#Prime|Primes]] cannot themselves bestow power to another creature, and require the assistance of a prime to do so. The primes are therefore reticent to do so independently to ensure they maintain a close balance in their strengths

They, like the power itself, are genderless, but each can identify as it sees fit and rarely, if ever, change following this decision.
### Idol
A non-divine creature that has a level of associated faith that has elevated them to the divine. These creatures may have cultivated their own following, elevating them to a level of divine power, or may be demi-gods in their own right. It is unknown whether Idols are immortal, mortal, or both.

In circles of backroom theology, members of the Arcandor Academy claim to have seen information in association with this leading to rumours, but it appears these individuals have been met by the Guardians of Il'Mondum not to be seen again. Idols are not widely known about by the population of the modern age due to their affiliation with forbidden faiths.
### Prime
Theology indicates that there were two powers that shaped and formed the planes and the pantheon, though there is obviously no way for this to be verified. These Primes are believed to work in balance and originally held far more power than the Ascendant and Emergent deities. 
### Shattered
[[#Emergent]] gods are manifestations of power and energy; though they can take human form when not in the Astral Plane, as with all natural energy it cannot be created or destroyed, purely transformed. As such, though an Emergent god cannot be killed, it can be shattered, transformed into many disparate parts. This shattering is caused when two Emergent powers collide. One of stronger power will overcome the weaker, causing it to fracture and eventually shatter. Two equal powers colliding results in both ultimately shattering in a stalemate.

As with anything broken, it can be repaired; the shards of a shattered god can be brought together to reform it, restoring the deity to its previous strength. This can happen naturally over eons or through the labour of bringing these shattered powers together.

Myth among mortals indicates the power of a shattered deity can be wielded by mortals, but it is unknown how. If this is the case, theologians theorise that the likeliest way this could occur is by a divine power locking a shard into an item, and that a deity would not be able to reform until all parts are released from these items. If these powers can be wielded, it is a closely guarded secret by the temples and orders of clerics.
