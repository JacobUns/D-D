### Ascendant
Mortal creatures can become [[#Deity|Deities]] by bestowal of power by one of the existing pantheon. Doing so delegates the mortal a portion of its own raw power in the same way as for [[#Emergent]] [[#Deity|Deities]]. Ascendency is, therefore, mythical in nature when discussed by mortals. Due to the nature of ascendancy, the mortal becomes immortal and part of the energy that makes up the planes.
### Deity
An immortal manifestation of power. It is created with certain responsibilities and domains as decided by the creator. Usually, this is done when a deity loses interest in the domain, and create a deity who embodies the very nature of that domain to serve as its keeper and protector.
### Emergent
Emergent gods are "born" of the power bestowed upon them by their "parent". In sacrificing some of their power, they leave themselves weaker and vulnerable to their counterparts. As a result, deities are typically created in cohorts to ensure equilibrium.

[[#Deity|Deities]] other than [[#Prime|Primes]] cannot themselves bestow power to another 

They, like the power itself, are genderless, but each can identify as it sees fit and rarely, if ever, change following this decision.
### Corrupted

### Idol
A lesser creature that has some level of associated faith. These creatures may have cultivated their own following, elevating them to a level of divine power, or may be demi-gods in their own right, but they are not immortal.
### Shattered
[[#Emergent]] gods are manifestations of power and energy; though they can take human form when not in the Astral Plane, as with all natural energy it cannot be created or destroyed, purely transformed. As such, though an Emergent god cannot be killed, it can be shattered, transformed into many disparate parts. This shattering is caused when two Emergent powers collide. One of stronger power will overcome the weaker, causing it to fracture and eventually shatter. Two equal powers colliding results in both ultimately shattering in a stalemate.

As with anything broken, it can be repaired; the shards of a shattered god can be brought together to reform it, restoring the deity to its previous strength. This can happen naturally over eons or through the labour of bringing these shattered powers together.

Myth among mortals indicates the power of a shattered deity can be wielded by mortals, but it is unknown how. If this is the case, theology indicates that the likeliest way to do this would be form them to be imbued by divine power into items, and that a deity would not be able to reform until all parts are released from these items. If these powers can be wielded, it is a closely guarded secret by the temples and orders of clerics.
### Prime
Theology indicates that there were two powers that shaped and formed the planes and the pantheon, though there is obviously no way for this to be verified. These Primes are believed to work in balance and originally held far more power than the Ascendant and Emergent deities.

## The Dark Six
The Dark Six are well recognised, but often aligned with evil and therefore are socially frowned upon. It is rare for these gods to be worshipped openly in many major cities, but shrines and small temples can still be found in more rural areas. This is especially true of The Fury and The Traveller, as many argue these are not inherently evil paths. Still, these deities are often revered behind closed doors, or by cults, rather than the general population.

### Draconic
#### Gods
It is theorised that Gods or Idols created by [[#Arawai]]'s power, but as worship of the Draconic faiths has fallen to disrepute so too has the common knowledge of who or what these [[#Deity|deities]] may have been. Scraps of history shared by the Arcandor Academy seem to indicate at least one name of a Draconic [[#Deity]]; Vol, the Deathless Martyr. It is secretly theorised that [[#Erador]] may have had a hand in the creation of a new god with [[#Arawai]], and that they therefore may continue to exist.
#### Faiths
With the destruction of the Draconic race during The Ending War, the faiths associated were banned from being practised by the races that remained. Any worship of these faiths is subject to discipline by the Guardians of Il'Mondum.

### Dwarven
As one of the factions that did not involve themselves in the formation of the council, the dwarves claim to have their own pantheon. World Theologians believe these to be the same pantheon of gods, simply known by different names. This is disputed by the Dwarves due to the nature of their worship being different to those gods of the council.

To anyone outside of the dwarven culture, the pantheon represented and worshipped by the dwarves is a topic of some disdain; the dwarves do not draw a line between The Dark Six and The Sovereign Host, worshipping each in their own right, which causes much unrest in the council and its theologically advisors.
