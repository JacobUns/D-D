# About
This page details the playable races within the world of [[Aothir]]. Each contains a breakdown about the race, if applicable, that details how they fit into the world, and sub-race options to choose from. This is a fairly extensive list of the most common choices, but if there is a race that you wish to play, please reach out to your game master and find out if the option can be accommodated. Ultimately, this is all in aid of your character creation, and fitting seamlessly into the game master's vision, so use this as a guide for communication and ideation more than strict rules.

# Aasimar
## About
- Bear within their souls the light of the Gods
- Aasimar are commonly born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events
- They are a people of extreme beauty, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage
- They are guardians of law and good
- Their godly patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice
- Receive visions and guidance via dreams to help shape them and grant them a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness
- They like to keep a low profile as they inevitably draw attention from cultists, fiends and other enemies of good who wish to strike down a celestial champion
- Those Aasimar who have not fallen have a link to an angelic being. This being is the one that provides guidance to the Aasimar via dreams.
- The angelic being, usually a Deva, is not omniscient and its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it may be able to give insight when combating especially powerful evils that it has knowledge of
- The angels that guide Aasimar see the world from a distant perch, and an Aasimar that wishes to save a town from drought may find themselves being urged onwards by their to accomplish a greater quest, as saving a few might pale in comparison to defeating a greater evil. Guides are not infallible.
- Aasimar are mortal and possess free will, most follow their ordained path but some grow to see their abilities as a curse, never to be able to live a normal life.
- Disaffected Aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world and retreat from it, though some turn evil, with belief that their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing. These Aasimar are abandoned by their angelic guide.
## Race Options
### Fallen
- One who has been touched by dark powers as a youth or has turned to evil in early adulthood can become fallen. Their inner light turns to shadow.
### Protector
- Charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, strike down evil wherever it arises, and stand vigilant against the darkness.
### Scourge
- Are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil, a desire that is at best unflinching and at its worst, all-consuming.
- Many wear masks to attempt to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.
## Aasimar Player considerations
- Who is your angelic being?
- What is their name?
- What is their temperament?
- Are they lecturing, compassionate, vengeful, judgemental, parental etc.?
- Which god are you a champion of?
# Dragonborn
## About
- Typically, their scales are brass or bronze in colour, though also range into scarlet, rust, gold or copper-green due to years of interbreeding between types of dragonborn.
- Used to have scales that matched their ancestral dragons, which include bright red, green, blue, white, black, gold, silver, brass, copper or bronze.
- Dragonborn with these colour scales have a strong bloodline back to their ancient dragons and gravitate towards the temperament of such a dragon.
- Born of dragons, they walk proudly through a world that fears them for naught but ignorance
- Not much is known about how the dragonborn came to be, though many rumours exist. Some claim they were created by a god that takes the form of a dragon, others claim they were born of the most ancient of dragons. 
## Dragonborn
- These Dragonborn variants have tails
- Some are faithful servants to true dragons while others follow their clan as warriors, or find themselves a drift with no clear calling in life.
- Their lore and stories tell of when these people used to be conquerors
- They kept the [[#Ravenite]] as slaves, until an uprising and rebellion where the Ravenites took their freedom
### Draconblood
- Lore written has been transferred to dragonborns for simplicity, though the variant may be chosen for the ASI
### Dragonborn Player considerations
- What colour dragonborn are you?    
- Are you descended from a more pure line of dragons?

- Those above the surface are usually exiles

- Have no appreciation of beauty, as the mindflayers stamped this out during their enslavement
- Lead bleak, grim lives devoid of happiness but see this as their defining strength rather than a drawback to be corrected

- Why are you/is your family connected to a powerful house?
# Elf

## High
- The High Elf domain is that of [[Lothlorel]]
- The capital city of [[Lothlorel]] is named [[Dolan Othrond]], which in common roughly translates to The Hidden City
- The city of [[Dolan Othrond]]
- Two main types of High Elf
- First are reclusive and stay within the elvish race, believing themselves superior to other races, resulting in a haughty temperament.
- The other is more common and friendly, and can often be encountered among humans and other races
- Have great respect for tradition and strive to perfect the techniques of their ancestors.
- Within elvish society very little has changed in thousands of years, while the world around them has continued to develop and innovate.
- With centuries to develop their skills, elves are often considered masters crafts.
## Wood
- The Wood Elf domain is that of [[Sylvaneth]]
- The capital city of [[Sylvaneth]] is named [[Emel Nimloth]], which in common roughly translates to The Heart Tree
- The city of [[Emel Nimloth]] is based around that of the heart tree itself, an ancient tree with a trunk wide and tall enough to house an entire people in its trunk. It is visible for miles when looking upon the forest of [[Sylvaneth]], and as such it has become a sacred part of the wood elf life.
- [[Emel Nimloth]] is a sprawling city highly protected by the Wood Elves. Outsiders and untrusted parties are forbidden unless decreed by the council of elders. 
## Dark
- These Dark Elves, also known as the Drow, are descendants from a subrace of elves that were banished for following dark gods and leading lives of evil.
- They live in the [[Underdark]], still following the rights of the gods their ancestors followed.
- Their skin resembles the colour of charcoal or obsidian, and they have stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes that can be mistaken for white in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red or blue.
- They tend to be slightly smaller than their elvish cousins
### Dark Elf Player considerations
- Drow adventurers are very rare indeed. As such, what made your character leave the relative safety of the [[Underdark]] to brave the perils of the light?
- Drow, like Duergar, are sensitive to sunlight, meaning they have disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks that rely on sight when their target is in direct sunlight. This is a major disadvantage, how would your character combat this?
## Aereni
- [[Aerenal]], an island off the coast of [[Lothlorel]], is ruled by the Undying Court
- The Undying Court is a council of undead elves sustained by positive energy and can wield godlike power.
- The court has sustained Aerenal for thousands of years.
- The greatest heroes of your people join the court after death, and great achievements in an Elf’s life may mean immortality in the court.
- The Aereni are typically isolationists who have little interests in the world.
- The Aereni believe the Nation Powers offer only chaos and war
### Aereni Player considerations
- What made you leave your island and wander the world?
- Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court?
- Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors?
- Are you an exile, banished from your homeland for crimes against the Undying Court?
- What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills?
- Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what’s your relationship with them?
- Do you find dealing with the short-lived races to be a challenge, or are you patient with them?
## Valenar
- After settling in Aerenal thousands of years ago, a small number settled on the mainland in Lothlorel, and founded the city of Valen.
- The people of Valen are dedicated to the arts of war, and millennia ago would have been warriors of an epic war battling in many kingdoms. The greatest of your heroes live on after death and are known as the patron ancestors.
    
- When you became an adult, one such ancestor formed a bond with you, and it has become your duty to follow their footsteps, living your life as they lived their and allowing them to live through you.
    
- Because of your patreon ancestors, your people have always searched out challenges worthy of a hero.
    
### Valenar Player considerations
- In choosing a valenar elf, your class should reflect that of your patron.
- If you’re a wizard, your ancestry was likely a legendary archmage. Who were they? Why were they so prominent?
- If you’re a ranger, was your ancestor a famous blademaster, or a stealthy hunter?
- What was your ancestors temperament? Chivalrous, merciless, bold, clever etc.?
- Are you embracing your patron or resisting it?
- Each patron is tied to many Valenar, so would you have a rival who channels the same ancestor, or a rival of your ancestor?
- How are you guided by that ancestor? Are you driven by visions? Or do they appear to you in dreams? Or are you pursuing an epic quest that mimics their deeds?
## Elf Player considerations
- Do you value the traditions of your ancestors?
- Do you fear your people are too mired in the past and need to find a way forward?
- How would that change how your character sees the world?
- Might their opinions change while in the world? And if so, what would it require to change that view?
# Firbolg
- A tribal people
- Cloister in remote forest strongholds, preferring to spend their lives in quiet harmony with the woods
- When provoked, Firbolgs can show great skills with weapons and druidic magic
- See forests as sacred places, representing the heart of the world and durability of life
- Are caretakers of the forests, attempting to maintain balance in and with nature
- Gather excess stores in the summer months to ensure the creatures of the forest can eat during the winter months
- In a Firbolg’s eyes, there is no greater fault than greed.
- They believe the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs
- Don’t care for gems or gold
- Firbolgs have a strong affinity for druidic magic, and almost every one learns a few spells to mask their presence, but many go on to master nature magic.
- Druid Firbolgs typically go on to become stronghold leaders, and weigh all actions taken by their tribe against both the good of the tribe as well as good of the nature around them. They would rather go hungry than strain the land during famine.
- They prefer to stay out of sight and mind
- Don’t try to dominate nature, but rather ensure that it prospurs according to its own laws
- They avoid politics of Elves, Humans and Orcs by masking their presence in the forests. Only care for politics when it affects the forests.
## Firbolg Player considerations
- Few Firbolgs would ever dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. Why has your character left the safety of the forest? Are they an exile? Or has their clan been destroyed?
- Outcast firbolgs can never return home as they have committed some unforgivable deed that would put their homeland at risk. If you are an exile, what was your deed?
- A few rare Firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission. If you fit into this category, what is your mission?
# Genasi
- A people born of genies and mortals.
- Genies, who reside on the [[Elemental Planes]] which are inhospitable to those of the [[Material Plane]], occasionally make the crossing to the [[material plane]] through their own free will or as compelled by magic. Some can adopt mortal forms and travel incognito.
- During such visits, a mortal may become involved with a genie and the resulting child is a Genasi. Tied to two planes but belonging to neither.
- Genasi inherit the resemblance of humanoids but have unusual skin colouration, such as red, green, blue or gray.
- The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each Genasi, often as magical power
- Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents.
- Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring seeing them as accidents, many feeling nothing for their Genasi children
- Many genasi live as outcasts, exiled due to their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assume leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands.
- Genasi rarely lack confidence seeing themselves as equal to any challenge. This can take the form of graceful sel-assurance in one and arrogance in another.
- Self-confidence can sometimes blind Genasi to risk, often getting themselves and/or others into trouble. Too much failure can chip away at a Genasi’s sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, hounding their talents and perfecting their craft.
- A Genasi may go their entire lives without encountering another of their kind.
- Genasi don’t have cities or empires, and seldom have communities of their own, typically adopting the cultures and societies they’re born into.
- The more strange a Genasi appears, the harder time they have.
- Many try to lose themselves in teeming cities while other in more rural areas may face suspicious glares, the cold shoulder, ostracism or even violent action from those they mistake as their friends.
- Genasi typically seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes or underground.
- Far from common, air and fire Genasi are more likely to be found in {Continent Name} in the badlands or to the north, whereas water and earth Genasi are more likely to be found in the mountains or coastlines of {Continent Name}
## Air
- Descended from the Djinn
- Moods can shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, like the wind
- Light blue skin, hair and eyes
- Faint but constant breeze is ever present around them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing
- Some speak in breathy voices marked by a faint echo
- A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps
## Earth
- Descended from a cruel and greedy Dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil
- Inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power
- Tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action
- Some earth Genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe
- Others can be as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates
- Can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating or tiny embedded crystals
- The most striking have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines
## Fire
- Descended from Efreet, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind
- Tend toward impatience and making snap judgments
- Exult in your distinctive appearance
- Nearly all are feverishly hot as if burning inside
- Flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones
- Some more human looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion
- More exotic Genasi may have actual flames instead of hair
- Voices like crackling flames, and eyes flare when angered
- May be accompanied by a faint smell of brimstone
## Water
- You have a passion for everything water; the shoreline, seas and oceans call to you.
- You have a free soul and take pride in your independence, though others may consider you selfish
- Most look as though they have just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair
- Smell of fresh rain and clean water
- Blue or green skin tones
- Somewhat overly large blue-black eyes
- Hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater
- Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of wale song or trickling streams.
## Genasi Player considerations
- Some Genasi are born of unions between Genie and Mortal, some through two Genasi parents, and others through dormant family genetics. Some are born as a result of exposure to a surge of elemental power, such as an eruption from the [[Inner Planes]] or a planar convergence, causing elemental power to saturate creatures in the area and altering their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as Genasi. How do you get your Genasi heritage?
- Genasi are rare, how did you grow up? Were you looked on unfavourably?
- Your type of Genasi should be linked to that of your Genie heritage
- Do you have any interest in knowing who your Genie descendancy comes from?
- Your humanoid traits are linked to your mortal parentage, do you have pointed ears like an elf? Thick hair/beard like a dwarf? Human features or large hands and feet like a halfling? Larger than normal eyes like a Gnome?
- Where are you from? A teeming metropolis or a rural area? What was your upbringing like? Do you blend in with the crowd or stick out like a sore thumb?
- What quirks do you have about the way you look? Are you a smooth skinned earth Genasi with gemstone protrusions, or does your body manifest strangely according to your emotions?

- Seek to trap and enslave any creature encountered, but flee from opposition that seems too daunting
- Employ pit traps, snares, and nets to catch the unwary
- Patrols usually look for ways to capture their foes instead of killing them
- Goblins that run up against the fringes of a society first test its defenses by stealing objects, and if this goes unpunished, they start stealing people
- Enslaved creatures receive the worst treatment the goblins can dish out while still getting decent performance out of the slave
- Humanoids and monsters that are especially capable or provide unusual services find themselves treated like favoured, though abused, pets.
- Keep rats and wolves as humans would keep dogs and horses, and use them for similar purposes

## Pariahs
- May be the most dimwitted, least educated and weakest goblins
- Have the worst jobs, such as mucking out animal pens, cleaning up after other goblins and doing any hard labor such as digging mines
- If a tribe has slaves to do some work, the pariah families enjoy the opportunity to supervise and dominate such creatures, who have no status at all.
- Gatherers and Pariahs greatly fear for their lives in battle, believing the lashers and hunters have special knowledge of how to survive. It is the members of the lower castes that give goblins their reputation for cowardice.
- Families are tiered based on how important they are to the clan’s survival
- Families in higher tiers keep their status by not sharing their knowledge, lower tiers have little change in escaping their fate
- Outsiders can be surprised by how goblins interact with them differently based on their caste tier
- Goblins are very unlikely to be spellcasters, as they lack the intelligence and patience to learn, have a lack of divine power given to them, and no patron would choose them as a warlock.
- For details on spellcasting as a Goblin, see information on Booyahgs.
## Goblin player considerations
- What caste are you from?
- What role would you have facilitated in your tribe?
- Why do you no longer reside within your tribe?
