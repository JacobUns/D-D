# Description
> As you enter this room you see it's clearly a dining room. One wall is a massive window which looks out onto plant beds filled with vegetation. From the ceiling hangs a crystal chandelier above a table made of dark wood with six matching wooden chairs with scarlet cushions surrounding it. A seventh chair sits alone in the far corner of the room.
>
> The walls are decorated with fairly unremarkable tapestries that depict grapevines and the process of making wine.
